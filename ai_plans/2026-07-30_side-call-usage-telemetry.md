# Count every LLM call, not just the ones in the conversation

Date: 2026-07-30
Scope: `src/` + `packages/` (emission) and `self-hosted-cloudapi/` (display)
Branches, stacked in this order on `feat/cloud-web-model-attribution`:

1. `feat/telemetry-side-call-usage` — the extension emits what it spends off the main loop
2. `feat/cloud-web-side-call-metrics` — the console shows it, and stops mis-attributing because of it

---

## 1. The gap

The metrics page under-reports against the local inference server, and the
reason is not sampling or a lost day: **only the main task loop emits an
`LLM Completion` event.** Every other call the extension makes to the same
endpoint is invisible — it costs prompt-processing time on the server and
appears nowhere in the console.

Measured against the code, 2026-07-30:

| Call site                                                     | Emits today | Usage available there                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Task loop (`TaskApiLoop.ts:1159` → drain)                     | yes         | full                                                      |
| Condense (`core/condense/index.ts:313`)                       | **no**      | full — `streamSummary` receives the `usage` chunk         |
| Enhance prompt (`webview/messageEnhancer.ts:80`)              | **no**      | discarded: `completePrompt` returns a bare `string`       |
| Memory side-query (`core/memory/memoryTaskIntegration.ts:43`) | **no**      | same                                                      |
| Code-index embeddings (`services/code-index/embedders/*`)     | **no**      | full — embedders already sum `promptTokens`/`totalTokens` |
| Microcompaction                                               | n/a         | deterministic, makes no LLM call                          |

One correction to an earlier reading: a **cancelled request does emit**, as long
as the provider reported usage before the cancel — the drain runs after the
abort break (`TaskApiLoop.ts:648`) and `captureUsageData` fires on any non-zero
figure. What is genuinely lost is a request killed before the first `usage`
chunk, whose prompt the server had already processed.

## 2. Two traps this has to avoid

**T1 — `modelId` does not come from the event.** It is filled from the
_provider's current task_ (`ClineProvider.getTaskProperties`,
`ClineProvider.ts:4134`). Condense and enhance routinely run on a different
profile, so an event emitted without an explicit model would be labelled with
whatever the open task happens to use. Event properties take precedence over
provider properties in `BaseTelemetryClient.getEventProperties`, so each side
call must state its own `modelId`/`apiProvider`.

**T2 — the Zod schema silently strips undeclared properties.** `CloudTelemetryClient.capture`
posts `rooCodeTelemetryEventSchema.safeParse(payload).data`, and Zod drops
unknown keys. This is exactly why 16 393 `Tool Used` rows carry no `tool`
(D5 in the GUI-overhaul plan). Every new property is declared in the schema or
it does not exist.

**T3 — per-request model attribution breaks the moment this ships.** The join
built in `feat/cloud-web-model-attribution` matches `api_req_started` messages
to `LLM Completion` events on `(inputTokens, outputTokens)`, in order. Condense
and enhance events land on the same `taskId` and would be matched to
conversation rows. The reader must filter to task-kind completions; legacy rows
(no kind) stay task-kind.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 A kind on every completion

`LLM Completion` gains `completionKind: "task" | "condense" | "enhance" | "memory"`,
absent meaning `"task"` for rows written before this. Plus `usageReported: boolean`
— false when a provider could not tell us what the call cost, so the console can
say "3 calls, figures unknown" instead of "3 calls, 0 tokens".

### 3.2 Embeddings are a different animal, so a different event

`Embedding Usage` — its own event type carrying `{modelId, apiProvider,
promptTokens, totalTokens, source}`. Not folded into `LLM Completion`, because
indexing a repository is hundreds of thousands of tokens with no output and no
cost, and folding it in would swamp the conversation figures it is meant to sit
beside. It gets its own tile.

### 3.3 Recovering usage from `completePrompt`

`SingleCompletionHandler.completePrompt` returns `Promise<string>` and throws the
usage away, in all 23 providers. Rather than change that signature (23 call
sites, every provider test, every test double), each provider gains a sibling:

```ts
interface SingleCompletionHandler {
	completePrompt(prompt: string): Promise<string>
	completePromptWithUsage?(prompt: string): Promise<CompletionResult>
}
```

and its existing body moves into `completePromptWithUsage`, with `completePrompt`
delegating:

```ts
async completePrompt(prompt: string): Promise<string> {
	return (await this.completePromptWithUsage(prompt)).text
}
```

Behaviour is unchanged by construction — same request, same return value — and
the diff per provider is small. Callers go through one helper,
`runCompletion(handler, prompt)`, which prefers the usage-bearing method and
falls back to the plain one, so a provider that has not been converted (or an
external implementor) still works and simply reports `usageReported: false`.

### 3.4 Where the numbers come from

- **Condense**: `streamSummary` already reads the `usage` chunk but keeps only
  `cost` and `outputTokens`. It keeps all of it now and returns it.
- **Enhance / memory**: from `runCompletion`.
- **Embeddings**: the call site of `createEmbeddings`, which already receives
  `{promptTokens, totalTokens}`.

## 4. The console (branch 2)

- Attribution filters to `completionKind` task/absent — correctness, not display.
- A **kind breakdown** beside the by-model and by-mode tables: what the
  conversation cost versus what the machinery around it cost.
- An **Indexing** tile: embedding tokens for the period, separate from the
  token total.
- The task detail page names side calls in the header rollup without letting
  them into the per-request badges.

## 5. Non-goals

- Re-pricing embeddings. No provider reports a cost for them and this
  deployment runs them locally; tokens are the honest unit.
- A request killed before its first `usage` chunk. Nothing to report, and
  guessing is worse than a gap.

## 6. Outcome

Both branches built and tested. Extension: **6978 tests pass** (was 6919).
Console: **170 pass** (was 157).

### What each call site now reports

| Kind       | Model reported            | Figures                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `task`     | the task's                | as before, now stated rather than implied |
| `condense` | the condensing handler's  | the whole usage chunk, not two fields     |
| `enhance`  | the enhancement profile's | from `completePromptWithUsage`            |
| `memory`   | the task's                | from `completePromptWithUsage`            |
| embeddings | the embedder's provider   | `promptTokens`, tagged by source          |

All 23 providers were converted. Behaviour is unchanged by construction — the
existing body moved, `completePrompt` delegates — and the 26 provider test files
that exercise `completePrompt` pass untouched.

### The correctness fix this forced (T3)

`attribute_requests` and the model rollups now filter through
`task_completions()`. Without it a condense event landing between two turns
matches a conversation row on its token pair and labels it with the background
model. Pinned by `test_a_condense_event_is_never_matched_to_a_conversation_row`.

### Defects found while building

- **`messageEnhancer`'s test mock was testing the catch block.** It stubbed
  `getProfile` while the code calls `activateProfile`, so both tests covering
  the enhancement-config path asserted on a caught `TypeError` rather than on
  the behaviour they name. Pre-existing; fixed here because the file had to be
  touched anyway.
- **The kind-split panel had no padding** and its cost column ran flush to the
  panel edge — every other panel on the page insets its content.
- **The Indexing tile had no accent rule** while the four beside it did. It
  takes the "you" hue rather than one of the four token/cost hues, because it
  is the one tile on that row that is not counting the conversation.

### Verification

Layout checked against a clone of the production database with synthetic
side-call and embedding events (the extension side is not deployed, so the real
corpus has none). Screenshots confirmed: the split panel reads
Conversation / Condensing / Memory recall with proportion bars, the Indexing
tile reports 1.5M across 21 calls broken down by source, and a task detail shows
`Condensing 9 · 417.6k tok · Memory recall 26 · 110k tok` under a model list
that stays the conversation's alone.

### Operational note

[UPDATE 2026-09-27: merged to main, verified by content. Both halves are live: the cloud api image is a
main@059bac30c build (rebuilt and redeployed 2026-09-27) and the installed VSIX is the main build from
2026-09-27 18:51.]

Both branches are unmerged and neither is deployed. The console half needs
`docker compose up -d --build api`; the extension half needs a rebuilt VSIX.
Until the extension ships, the console renders exactly as before — every stored
row is a conversation turn, the split panel stays hidden and there is no
Indexing tile.
