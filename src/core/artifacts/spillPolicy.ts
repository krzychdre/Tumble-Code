/**
 * Tools whose results never spill.
 *
 * Three reasons, and they are different:
 *
 * 1. `PROTOCOL_TOOL_NAMES` (`src/shared/tools.ts`): the result is protocol or
 *    instructions the task machinery or the next turn consumes, so a preview
 *    changes behaviour instead of saving context. Shared with microcompact's
 *    never-clear set so the two policies cannot drift apart.
 * 2. `read_file`: its schema promises whole-file reads (up to its own line cap)
 *    and tells the model not to re-read what it already has. Cutting a file to a
 *    120-line preview would break that contract, and read_file already caps
 *    itself, so there is nothing to protect the context from.
 * 3. Tools that already window or resolve their own output: `read_artifact`
 *    (offset/limit/search - spilling a window into a new artifact would make the
 *    model chase its own tail) and `access_mcp_resource` (a resource the model
 *    asked for by URI, usually a schema or document it needs whole).
 * 4. `search_task_history` for the same reason as `read_artifact`, plus a
 *    sharper one: it SEARCHES the artifact directory. Spilling its result would
 *    write an artifact that the next search then finds, so the tool would start
 *    returning its own past output instead of the conversation. It caps itself
 *    (50 hits of at most 800 bytes) and, being on this list, the WS-C pruner
 *    leaves it alone too.

 * when the replacement is at most half the size of the original.
