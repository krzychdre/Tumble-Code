// WS-F: the system prompt has to be KV-cache friendly.
//
// A provider that caches by prompt prefix (llama.cpp locally, Z.ai/GLM and
// DeepSeek-style prefix caches remotely) reuses a cached request only up to the
// first byte that differs. Two properties are therefore load-bearing and are
// asserted here against the REAL assembly, never a stub:
//
//  1. BYTE STABILITY: the same inputs produce byte-identical output, so nothing
//     volatile (a timestamp, a Map iteration order, a locale-dependent sort)
//     leaks into the prompt.
//  2. COMMON-PREFIX MAXIMIZATION: two modes on the same workspace share the
//     whole stable head, so a mode switch does not re-prefill from token 1.

	 *   8252  WS-F, when the stable head first landed.

	 *         66 bytes (8252 - 66 = 8186).
	 *   8196  opener reword v2 (this round): the conditional phrasing "if it has
	 *         any" and the single-referent bindingness clause add 10 bytes back
	 *         (8186 + 10 = 8196). The no-hub figure moved by the same 10, from

	 * into the tail because it turned out to be mode-dependent). Lowering it
