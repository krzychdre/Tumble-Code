 * Minimal correct invocations for every advertised static tool.
 *
 * Weak models (Qwen 27B, GLM, local Llamas) recover from a malformed tool call in one
 * turn when the error text shows them a working call instead of only naming what was
 * wrong. Every corrective message the model receives (missing parameter, unfinalizable
 * native arguments, repetition limit, consecutive-mistake limit) carries the entry from
 * this map, so all of them speak the same vocabulary.
 *
 * The values are plain objects, not strings, and they are embedded as a nested JSON
 * object in the tool result envelope. That matters: a string value would be escaped a
 * second time inside the envelope and the model would have to unescape it before it
 * could copy anything. As objects, they arrive in exactly the wire shape the model has
 * to reproduce in the `arguments` of a native tool call.
 *
 * Each example contains only the parameters the tool schema marks as required (explicit
 * `null` where the schema is `strict` and lists a nullable optional in `required`), and
 * `examples.spec.ts` locks that against schema drift.

 *   registered name and carries its own schema.
 * - `use_mcp_tool` is never in the advertised tool list either: MCP tools are generated
 *   per server as `mcp--<server>--<tool>` by `getMcpServerTools()`, each with its own
 *   schema.
 *
 * They are excluded by construction rather than filled with a placeholder that a model
 * could copy into a call that would then fail.
