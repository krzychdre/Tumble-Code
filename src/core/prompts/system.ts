/**
 * The first bytes of every system prompt, in every mode, for every profile.
 *
 * Providers that cache by prompt prefix (llama.cpp locally, Z.ai/GLM and
 * DeepSeek-style prefix caches remotely) reuse a request's KV cache only up to
 * the first byte that differs. The mode's `roleDefinition` used to open the
 * prompt, so switching mode invalidated the cache from token 1. This opener is
 * a constant, and it names the sections where the mode's role and the mode's
 * rules really live, so a weak model still knows who it is and what it must do:
 * the pointer is load-bearing, not decorative.
 *
 * Both destinations are named on purpose. The MODE section carries only the
 * role definition; the mode's actual rulebook (a mode's `customInstructions`,
 * for example the orchestrator's delegation protocol) renders further down,
 * inside USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS. A pointer that named only the MODE section
 * would send a weak model to two sentences of persona and leave it reading its
 * own protocol as a user's wish.
 *
 * Every claim here has to be true in EVERY mode, because the string is a
 * constant and cannot adapt. Four rules follow from that:
 *
 *  - The second destination is phrased conditionally ("if it has any"). The
 *    rulebook renders as a "Mode-specific Instructions" block only when the
 *    mode actually has `customInstructions`; the default `code` mode has none
 *    (see `DEFAULT_MODES` in packages/types/src/mode.ts and the guard in
 *    sections/custom-instructions.ts). An earlier version of this opener
 *    promised that block unconditionally and so pointed a weak model at a
 *    section that is absent for the most-used mode of all.
 *  - No universal quantifier. An earlier version said "ANY mode-specific rules
 *    for you appear inside USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS", which is false as
 *    stated: AVAILABLE SKILLS also carries mode-scoped content (the list is
 *    filtered per mode, see sections/skills.ts). The sentence now claims only
 *    where the mode's OWN instructions go, which is true, instead of claiming
 *    that nothing mode-scoped lives anywhere else.
 *  - Bindingness has one unambiguous referent, "your mode". An earlier version
 *    ended with "Both are binding on you", whose two referents were the two
 *    destinations, and one of them (the mode's own instructions) can be empty
 *    in `code` mode, so the model was told an absent thing bound it.
 *  - The position is "later in this prompt", not "at the end": MODE is the
 *    fifth of seven tail sections, and USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS plus the
 *    deferred-tools catalog render after it.
 *
 * The two destinations are always there. MODE renders for every schema-valid
 * mode, because `modeConfigSchema.roleDefinition` is trim-aware and rejects a
 * whitespace-only value that would otherwise trim to "" and drop the section.
 * One known residual door remains: a `customModePrompts` override goes through
 * `promptComponentSchema`, which does not trim, and a whitespace-only override
 * is truthy, so it wins in `getModeSelection` (src/shared/modes.ts) and drops
 * MODE. Unreachable from the settings UI (it trims before saving); reachable
 * only programmatically. Recorded in
 * ai_plans/2026-08-25_prefix-opener-review-fixes.md as a follow-up candidate.
 * USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS renders unconditionally too, because the Language
 * Preference entry is always pushed into it (sections/custom-instructions.ts);
 * `prefix-stability.spec.ts` carries a guard test that fails if anyone puts
 * that entry behind a setting.
 *
 * Change this only with the "one-time prefix invalidation" note in the commit.
