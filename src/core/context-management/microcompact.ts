/**
 * Tool-result microcompaction.
 *
 * A cheap, deterministic, NO-LLM pre-pass that clears the *content* of OLD tool
 * results before resorting to the expensive, lossy full summarization
 * (`summarizeConversation`). This is a port of Claude Code's `microcompact`
 * stage, which runs before `autocompact` in its compaction pipeline. Old tool
 * output (file reads, command stdout, search results, ...) is the largest,
 * lowest-signal, fastest-growing portion of a coding conversation, so clearing
 * it reclaims the bulk of the tokens while leaving the entire dialogue —
 * user/assistant turns, decisions, and the `tool_use` requests themselves —
 * completely intact.
 *
 * Selection is need-adaptive and importance-aware rather than count-based: the
 * caller says how many characters it must reclaim, and this pass clears the
 * oldest results until that target is met, skipping results too small to pay for
 * their own placeholder and sparing the ones the context ledger marks critical.
 * A count rule cannot do this — "keep five" treats a 123-char test failure and a
 * 192 KB directory listing as the same thing.
 *
 * Because it makes no model call, it cannot fail or hallucinate on a weak local
 * model (GLM/Qwen/Llama); the cleared content is simply replaced with a fixed,
 * human-readable sentinel that tells the model how to recover the data if needed.
 */
