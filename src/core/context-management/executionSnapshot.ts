/**
 * Execution snapshot for task resumption.
 *
 * Resuming a task replays the conversation: `resumeTaskFromHistory()` reloads the full persisted
 * history and sends it as the first request after the pause. Measured on this workspace's task
 * store, that first request is a median of ~44k tokens and up to 384k, and in 70 of 78 resumes it
 * was LARGER than the last request before the pause — the interruption costs more than the work.
 *
 * This module replaces that replay with a snapshot of the execution *state*: the goal, the plan,
 * what changed, what is still broken, what was proven, and what can be cited. All of it comes
 * from the typed ledger, which is derived mechanically from the same history — so the snapshot
 * needs NO model call and cannot hallucinate. That is the whole reason it is not persisted at
 * checkpoint time: a deterministic function of already-persisted data is cheaper to recompute
 * than to store, and recomputing it cannot go stale, drift out of sync with the history, or need
 * a version migration.
 *
 * What CAN go stale is the workspace: the user may edit files while the task is paused, which
 * makes "already changed" and "tests passed" claims wrong. That is checked directly, per file,
 * against the mtimes of the files the ledger says were changed — a finer-grained binding than a
 * repo-wide hash, which can only say that *something* moved.
 *
 * Applying the snapshot is non-destructive, using the same tagging as condense: older messages
 * get a `condenseParent` and stay on disk, so rewind and the UI transcript are unaffected.
 * Every failure mode degrades to today's behaviour — a full replay — never to lost history.
