"""Per-task display summary — derived at write time, stored on the rows.

Why this exists
---------------
The task list used to derive everything it shows (title, message count, tokens,
cost) by loading *every message of every task* and JSON-parsing it on each page
view. Measured against the live deployment that was 387 queries and 205 MB of
text per request — 2.47s of server time for 55 541 messages — and it grew
linearly with the corpus forever.

A stored message is immutable in content once finalized, so re-deriving its
numbers on every read is pure waste. The fix is two-level:

1. **Per message.** When a message is written we parse its payload once and
   store the tokens/cost it contributes as plain numeric columns on
   ``task_messages``. Parsing happens exactly once per message, ever.

2. **Per task.** ``tasks`` carries the rolled-up totals. They are refreshed by a
   single indexed ``SUM``/``COUNT`` aggregate over that task's message rows —
   numbers only, no JSON, no text. Rendering the list is then one query with no
   per-task work at all.

Why not accumulate incrementally into the task row? Because the live bridge
upserts the *same* ``ts`` repeatedly as a message streams (created → partial →
final), and an ``api_req_started`` only learns its real token/cost figures in
its final revision. Adding deltas would double-count every re-upsert. Re-summing
the rows is idempotent by construction, which is the property that matters here.

The aggregation itself matches the VS Code view (``consolidateTokenUsage``) and
``static/render.js:getMetrics``: sum ``tokensIn``/``tokensOut``/``cacheWrites``/
``cacheReads``/``cost`` over every ``api_req_started`` say-message, plus the cost
of any ``condense_context``. ``contextTokens`` is deliberately not summed — it is
a live gauge of the *current* context, not a total.
