"""Applying a retention policy — and, first, saying exactly what it would do.

Design rule for this module: **nothing deletes without being able to say what it
is about to delete.** Every entry point comes in a pair — ``plan_*`` decides and
reports, ``apply_*`` executes exactly that plan. The settings page runs the plan
on every page load and shows it; the sweep runs the plan and then acts on it.
The two can never disagree, because they are the same function.

Two rules select tasks, and a task goes if *either* matches:

  age    older than ``max_age_days``, measured on ``updated_at`` (when the task
         was last written — the only time the row itself carries)
  count  beyond the newest ``max_tasks``

Shared tasks are exempt while ``keep_shared`` is set: a share URL was handed to
somebody, and a sweep should not silently break it.

Telemetry is swept separately and more aggressively, because ``Task Message``
events carry a full copy of every stored conversation — 146 MB duplicating the
479 MB in ``task_messages`` on this deployment. ``LLM Completion`` is **never**
swept: the whole metrics page is built from it, and the tasks cannot
reconstruct the cost history it holds.
