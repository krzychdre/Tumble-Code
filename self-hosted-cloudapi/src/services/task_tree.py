"""Parent/child task relationships — recording them, and reading the tree.

Where the data comes from
-------------------------
Roo Code spawns a subtask as a task in its own right, with its own id and its
own conversation. The only place the relationship is stated is telemetry: every
``Task Created`` (and in practice several later events) carries ``taskId``
alongside ``parentTaskId`` and ``isSubtask``. Nothing consumed it, so the web
view showed 150 subtasks as flat, orphaned entries with no way to tell which
run they belonged to.

Recording is two-sided because the event and the task row do not arrive in a
fixed order:

  * ``record_relation`` runs on every telemetry event that names a parent. It
    writes ``task_relations`` (which needs neither task to exist) and, if the
    child's row happens to be there already, stamps it.
  * ``adopt_from_relations`` runs when a task row is created, and stamps it from
    whatever ``task_relations`` already knows.

Between them the link survives either ordering, and no event has to be replayed.
