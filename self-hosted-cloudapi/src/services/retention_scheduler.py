"""Background loop that applies each user's retention policy on a schedule.

An in-process asyncio task rather than a cron entry or a worker process: this is
a single-container deployment, the sweep is a handful of DELETEs, and adding a
scheduler dependency to run it would be more machinery than the job is worth.

Two properties matter here and are deliberate:

- **It only ever acts on policies that are switched on.** A user who has never
  opened the settings page has a disabled policy and is never touched.
- **A failure never kills the loop.** Anything raised by a sweep is logged and
  the loop waits for the next interval, because an API server must not lose a
  background task to one bad row and then silently stop sweeping forever.
