    Used by the remote-control bridge: a ClineMessage streams through several
    states (created → partial updates → final) under one `ts`. We get-or-create
    the parent Task (so a live task becomes visible in the web list) and upsert
    the row keyed by (task_id, ts) so the read-only history mirrors the live view
    instead of accumulating duplicate partial rows.

    The collapse is done with a dialect-native `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`
    on the `(task_id, message_ts)` unique index. A non-atomic SELECT-then-write
    raced under rapid partial events (streaming reasoning), leaving duplicate
    `partial:true` rows that the finalizing update could never clean up.

    The `DO UPDATE` is **monotonic** so a streamed message can only advance
    toward its most-complete form. Without a guard, the concurrent per-event
    transactions for one `ts` serialize on the unique-index row lock and the
    *last to commit* wins — non-deterministically an early, short partial —
    freezing the row at truncated text + `partial:true`. The web view then shows
    only the opening words of a reasoning trace (e.g. "The user says").

    The guard:
    - A **final** message (`partial` falsy) is authoritative and always wins. It
      carries the full accumulated text, and there is exactly one per `ts`.
    - A **partial** may only overwrite when its payload is at least as long as
      the stored one. Streamed `partial:true` chunks carry the *accumulated*
      text (`_reasoningMessage += chunk`), so their `message_data` grows
      monotonically — a late, short partial is rejected and can never clobber a
      fuller payload or a finalize already in place.

    (Length only fails as a key across the partial→final boundary, where the
    final drops the `"partial":true"` flag and can be a few bytes shorter despite
    longer text — which is exactly why finals bypass the length check.)
