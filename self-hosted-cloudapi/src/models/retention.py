"""Per-user data-retention policy.

Nothing in this deployment ever deleted anything on its own, and the storage
shows it: ``task_messages`` reached 479 MB and ``telemetry_events`` 146 MB, with
the latter *duplicating* the former — the ``Task Message`` event carries the
whole ClineMessage, so every shared conversation is stored twice, in two tables,
in two formats.

The policy is per user rather than global because ownership is per user
everywhere else in this schema, and a sweep must never touch rows it cannot
attribute.
