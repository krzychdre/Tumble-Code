"""Functional checks for the browser-side code (static/*.js).

The renderer and the task-list selection are the two pieces of this app with
real behaviour that the Python suite cannot reach: folding, per-role defaults,
fold state surviving a live upsert, shift-click ranges, the subtask option, and
which confirmation a given button asks all live in the browser.

Rather than add a Node/Playwright toolchain for them, the assertions live in
self-contained pages under ``tests/browser/`` that load the *actual* static
assets, exercise them, and write their results into the DOM. This test drives
each page with whatever headless Chrome is on the machine and fails if any
assertion did.

Skipped — never failed — when no Chrome is installed, so the suite still runs on
a bare CI box.
