# Contributing to Tumble Code

Tumble Code is a community-driven fork of [Roo Code](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code), and we deeply value every contribution. To streamline collaboration, we operate on an [Issue-First](#issue-first-approach) basis, meaning all [Pull Requests (PRs)](#submitting-a-pull-request) must first be linked to a GitHub Issue. Please review this guide carefully.

## Before You Contribute

### 1. Code of Conduct

All contributors must adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### 2. Project Direction

Tumble Code inherits Roo Code's focus areas and extends them. Align your contributions with:

### Reliability First

- Ensure diff editing and command execution are consistently reliable.
- Reduce friction points that deter regular usage.
- Guarantee smooth operation across all locales and platforms.
- Expand robust support for a wide variety of AI providers and models.

### Enhanced User Experience

- Streamline the UI/UX for clarity and intuitiveness.
- Continuously improve the workflow to meet the high expectations developers have for daily-use tools.

### Leading on Agent Performance

- Establish comprehensive evaluation benchmarks (evals) to measure real-world productivity.
- Make it easy for everyone to easily run and interpret these evals.
- Ship improvements that demonstrate clear increases in eval scores.

Mention alignment with these areas in your PRs.

## Finding & Planning Your Contribution

### Types of Contributions

- **Bug Fixes:** Addressing code issues.
- **New Features:** Adding functionality.
- **Documentation:** Improving guides and clarity.

### Issue-First Approach

All contributions start with a GitHub Issue.

<!-- External issue-tracking guidance is hidden until contact channels are set up.
- **Check existing issues**: Search [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/krzychdre/tumble-code/issues).
- **Create an issue** describing:
    - **Enhancements:** plain-language description focused on user benefit.
    - **Bugs:** minimal repro + expected vs actual + version.
- **Want to work on it?** Comment "Claiming" on the issue to signal intent before opening a PR.
- **PRs must link to the issue.** Unlinked PRs may be closed.
-->

### Reporting Bugs

- Check for existing reports first.
- Create a new bug report with: - Clear, numbered reproduction steps - Expected vs actual result - Tumble Code version (required); API provider/model if relevant
  <!-- - **Security issues**: Report privately via [security advisories](https://github.com/krzychdre/tumble-code/security/advisories/new). -->

## Development & Submission Process

### Development Setup

1. **Fork & Clone:**

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tumble-code.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

```
pnpm install
```

3. **Debugging:** Open with VS Code (`F5`).

### Writing Code Guidelines

- One focused PR per feature or fix.
- Follow ESLint and TypeScript best practices.
- Write clear, descriptive commits referencing issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
- Provide thorough testing (`pnpm test`).
- Rebase onto the latest `main` branch before submission.

### Submitting a Pull Request

- Begin as a **Draft PR** if seeking early feedback.
- Clearly describe your changes following the Pull Request Template.
- Link the issue in the PR description/title (e.g., "Fixes #123").
- Provide screenshots/videos for UI changes.
- Indicate if documentation updates are necessary.

### Pull Request Policy

- Must reference an open GitHub Issue.
- Unlinked PRs may be closed.
- PRs should pass CI tests, align with the project direction, and have clear documentation.

### Review Process

- Iterate promptly based on maintainer feedback.
