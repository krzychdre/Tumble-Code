# Tumble Code Changelog

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- A model id that is not in a provider's model list is now always used as you typed it, with the capabilities and prices of the provider's default model, instead of being silently replaced by the default model (xAI, MiniMax, OpenAI, OpenAI Codex, Z.ai, Vertex, Gemini, LiteLLM and Bedrock used to do that). The API settings show a warning when the selected model id is unknown to the provider.
- **The CLI is rebuilt around a scrollback transcript.** Finished messages are printed into the terminal's own scrollback instead of being re-rendered inside a live region, so the history scrolls with the terminal, survives a resize and can be copied out. Only the in-flight message stays live, and its body is clamped so a long answer or a large tool result cannot push the prompt off screen.
- **Answers are no longer lost at the end of a turn.** A streamed message that was still marked partial when the agent went idle is now promoted to the transcript instead of disappearing with the live region, and a message finalized under the same timestamp as its streaming updates replaces that entry in place rather than being dropped as a duplicate.
- **Tool calls and thinking are readable.** Reads, writes, searches, commands and generic tools each render a compact preview with a result line, thinking blocks are visible while the model is reasoning, and ctrl+o toggles a verbose transcript that reprints the whole conversation, including the full bodies the compact view truncates.
- **Provider parity with the extension.** The CLI's provider list, API key fields, base-url fields and environment variables are derived from the shared provider registry instead of a hardcoded list of four, so every provider the extension supports is selectable from the command line, minus the seven providers retired in this same release. `--base-url` is rejected for providers whose schema has no base-url field instead of being silently persisted.
- **Sign in to ChatGPT subscriptions from the terminal** with `auth codex login`, and manage per-command approvals with the `permissions` command.
- **The extension mirrors its provider settings** to `~/.roo/cli-settings.json`, so the CLI starts on the same provider and model without being configured twice.
- **Startup is quiet:** the bundled release no longer prints the dotenv injection banner, and Node's `DEP0040` punycode deprecation warning is gone because the bundle now resolves the userland package instead of the deprecated built-in.
- **ripgrep ships with the CLI**, so file search works on a machine without VS Code installed.
- **New Anthropic models.** Added Claude Opus 5.5 and Claude Fable 5.1 on the Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex and OpenRouter providers, and Claude Opus 5 and Claude Sonnet 5 on Bedrock and Vertex, where they were missing. A custom Bedrock id for Opus 5 or Sonnet 5 no longer fails with a 400, because the whole Claude 5 family now gets the adaptive-thinking request shape.
- **New OpenAI models.** Added GPT-6 Astra, GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna, with OpenAI's long-context pricing above 272K input tokens.
- **Prompt caching for Claude Opus 5 and Sonnet 5.** On the Anthropic provider these two models, including the default Opus 5, were sent without cache markers, so every turn was billed at the full input price. They are now cached like every other Claude model, and models added later are cached automatically.
- **Corrected prices and cost estimates.** Claude Sonnet 5 is now priced at $2/$10 per million tokens (it was $3/$15). OpenAI cache writes, billed at 1.25 times the input price since GPT-5.6, are now counted, so OpenAI cost estimates are no longer too low.
- **OpenAI reasoning effort.** A reasoning effort saved for one model is no longer sent to a model that rejects it: switching to GPT-6 Astra with "none" selected used to fail with HTTP 400, and now falls back to the model's default.
- A new OpenAI profile now shows the model it actually uses (GPT-5.6 Sol) instead of GPT-4o.
- **Provider cleanup.** Seven redundant AI providers were retired: Poe, Unbound, Requesty and Vercel AI Gateway, which were niche brokers overlapping with OpenRouter and LiteLLM, plus Baseten, SambaNova and Fireworks, inference platforms whose models are reachable through OpenRouter anyway. An existing profile pointing at one of them still loads and reports that the provider is no longer supported, instead of failing outright.
- **New and updated models.** Added Claude Opus 5 and Claude Sonnet 5, with Opus 5 replacing the superseded Sonnet 4.5 as the Anthropic default; Gemini 3.7 Flash, 3.6 Flash and 3.5 Flash-Lite; Grok 4.6, 4.5 and 4.3, with 4.6 as the new xAI default; DeepSeek's experimental vision model; and Mistral Small 4, Medium 3.5, Large 3, Ministral 3 and the Z.ai GLM 5.2 passthrough.
- **Corrected model pricing.** GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra and Luna were priced well above their published rates, Luna by five times, which overstated every cost estimate on that family; DeepSeek was priced at its off-peak rates, which understated them. Both now follow the published standard rates.
- **Models retired by their providers.** Mistral's Devstral, Magistral and Pixtral entries are replaced by their actual successors now that Mistral has shut them down, three Gemini models Google has shut down are hidden from the model picker while existing profiles still resolve, and two DeepSeek compatibility aliases past their retirement date were dropped.
- Tumble Code now requires VS Code 1.102 or newer (previously 1.84). Editors older than 1.102 run extensions on Node 18 or 20, and the libraries the extension depends on have moved to Node 22; VS Code 1.102 is the first release whose extension host runs Node 22. Users on an older VS Code keep the version they have installed but no longer receive updates, which is why this is a minor release. The Tumble Code CLI now needs Node.js 22 or newer as well. With the newer floor the AWS SDK used for Amazon Bedrock is refreshed to its current release, which no longer needs the XML parser that had open security advisories.

### Patch Changes

- The cost recorded for Anthropic and MiniMax requests now includes the model's real output tokens. Both providers report a small provisional output count when a response starts and the final count at the end; the cost was computed from the provisional count only, so every response was billed as if it had produced about one output token and the recorded cost (in the chat and in the cloud cost table) was too low.
- Claude on Google Vertex now reports the request cost the same way as the Anthropic provider, without counting the first output token twice; the Anthropic, MiniMax and Vertex providers share one stream reader.
- Provider errors now keep their HTTP status on every provider (LM Studio, LiteLLM, Ollama, Mistral, Gemini, Bedrock, Anthropic on Vertex, OpenAI native and Codex among them), so a background model that is rate limited (429), rejects the request (400) or has bad credentials (401) falls back to the task's own model. The OpenAI provider no longer shows "OpenAI completion error:" twice in one message.
- OpenAI Codex now reports the prompt-cache writes of GPT-5.6 models in the token counts, like OpenAI Native already did. OpenAI Native and Codex now read the Responses API through one shared implementation, so both show the same text for the same answer: the rarely used plain-HTTP fallback no longer shows a text twice or shows tool status events as answer text, and an OpenAI Native error that gives its reason in a "detail" field shows that reason instead of raw JSON.
- xAI now reads its streamed answers the same way as OpenAI Native and Codex: tool calls stream while the model writes their arguments, and answer text that xAI sends only at the end of a response (or as a refusal) is shown instead of being dropped. Prompt-cache writes reported in the token details are counted as well.
- Amazon Bedrock requests behave exactly as before; internally the Bedrock provider now builds the request, reads the response stream and maps errors in separate, individually tested modules instead of one long function.
- Stop now closes the model request itself for every provider, so the server stops generating right away (no more billed tokens or a busy local GPU after you press Stop), and two requests running at the same time are cancelled independently.
- Exporting settings and previewing the system prompt no longer create a provider connection just to read the model details (an OpenRouter profile used to start downloading its model list), and a VS Code Language Model provider that is replaced by a mode or profile switch stops listening for configuration changes instead of lingering until the window closes.
- Internal cleanup with no change in behavior: Z.ai now converts its conversation history with the same code as DeepSeek (the two copies were identical), and unused code in the providers and shared helpers is removed.
- Background tasks (memory writers and parallel subagents) no longer give up on HTTP 429 (too many requests) after 7 attempts: they keep waiting and retrying (at most 10 minutes between attempts, or the delay the provider asks for) until the provider answers or the task is stopped; 429 retries do not count toward the 7-attempt limit for other errors.
- Parallel subagents and memory writers now follow the same provider profile rules as a normal task: a profile blocked by your organization is refused, and the profile's error and repetition limit applies.
- Background tasks (memory writers and parallel subagents) no longer retry failed API requests forever: they stop at once on 401, 403 or 404, always wait between retries (also with auto-approve off), and give up after 7 attempts; a parallel subagent reports the API error to its parent task.
- The remote-control bridge to a self-hosted cloud API now reconnects by itself after the server restarts. Before, a token that expired during the restart got the connection refused once, and the bridge stayed offline until VS Code was reloaded; now it retries after 1 s, 2 s, 4 s and so on, at most once a minute, while you are signed in.
- Cache writes are now counted for every OpenAI-compatible server that reports them (OpenRouter, Moonshot Kimi, Alibaba Qwen explicit caching, LiteLLM), in background calls such as context condensing as well as in chat, so token and cost figures no longer miss those tokens.
- Cache writes on a model that has no cache write price are now charged at the model's input price instead of being free. This affects models whose details you typed in yourself or that were fetched from a server without a write price, for example Claude through LiteLLM or an OpenAI Compatible endpoint, or Qwen explicit caching: their shown and recorded costs were too low (by up to about 75% on cache-heavy requests) and now rise to the correct level. A write price set explicitly to 0 still means free writes, and the built-in model list is not affected. Costs recorded before this change are not recalculated.
- The "Running" command row in the chat no longer opens its output automatically. Command output (which can run to thousands of lines for a diff or a test run) now starts collapsed and is opened with the chevron, exactly like the file read and diff rows, and the expanded state is remembered by the chat view instead of being lost when the row scrolls out of view. Collapsed output is not rendered at all, so long outputs no longer cost ANSI conversion work for rows nobody opened.
- The whole execute_command row in the chat can now be folded away, not just its output. A command can be as long as its output when a script is passed through a heredoc, so the collapsed row shows only the header with a one-line preview of the command, and the command block, the terminal output and the auto-approve pattern selector are not rendered at all until the chevron is used. The one exception is a command that is waiting for manual approval: that row opens by itself so the full command is visible before the Run Command / Reject decision, and collapsing it by hand still wins.
- OpenAI Compatible and LiteLLM no longer stop the request when a proxy sends a tool call in an unexpected shape and now report the end of each answer, so tool calls from local servers are finalized reliably; LM Studio now shows the model's reasoning when the server sends it separately.
- Qwen Code no longer shows a thinking block as answer text when its tags arrive split over several stream chunks, and no longer drops repeated indentation from streamed code; Qwen Code, DeepSeek, Z.ai and Moonshot now share one Chat Completions stream reader.
- Condensing a conversation now reports its cost for DeepSeek, OpenAI Compatible and Qwen Code instead of $0, DeepSeek reports prompt cache hits for one-shot requests too, and OpenAI Compatible o-series and Qwen Code requests report cached input tokens.
- The checkpoint saved before `new_task` and `generate_image` can now start as soon as the tool call begins streaming, as it already did for file edits, instead of always waiting until the tool is about to run.
- Internal: the CLI integration suite runs again, on every pull request, against a scripted model instead of a real provider, and the VS Code end-to-end suite can be started by hand from GitHub Actions.
- Settings: choosing "use current profile" for the compaction or memory writer profile, or emptying the memory folder, now really clears the saved value, and the Memory tab shows the values you saved instead of its defaults.
- The CLI and the settings page now use one rule for which providers need an API key. The settings page no longer saves a DeepSeek, Moonshot, MiniMax, xAI or Z.ai profile without a key (every request of such a profile failed). The CLI passes an Ollama API key on (from `--api-key`, the settings file or `OLLAMA_API_KEY`) instead of dropping it, and with `--provider openai`, `ollama` or `lmstudio` but no model it now says that a model is needed instead of sending the OpenRouter model id to your server.
- CLI tool rows now show what the VS Code chat rows show for the same tool call, because both read the tool payload through one shared reader. Web searches, web fetches, slash commands, skills, artifact reads, task history searches, plan reviews and image generations get a readable title with their query, URL, name or byte range instead of the raw internal tool name. A new subtask or a finished subtask no longer renders as "Switch Mode", a mode switch shows its reason, file and codebase searches show where they looked, the older edit tool names render as edits, and an applied diff shows the unified diff with real line numbers. The approval prompt for a web search or a slash command also shows the queries or the command name.
- The CLI no longer hangs when the model calls an MCP tool in the default `allow` permission mode. Automatic approval covered only the MCP tools listed under `alwaysAllow` in the server's config; any other tool waited for an approval that the CLI never asks for in this mode, so the task stopped with the spinner still running. `allow` now approves every MCP tool, as documented. Follow-up questions and the plan review gate still ask as before.
- A command that needs a password can now ask for it inside the CLI. Cloning a private repository, pushing over HTTPS or using an ssh key with a passphrase used to be impossible from a task: the command had no terminal to prompt on, so it simply failed. It now asks in the interface, in a bordered prompt that names the command and repeats its question, and the answer goes straight back to the waiting command. Typing is hidden for anything that is a secret, and left visible for questions that are not, so ssh's "continue connecting (yes/no)?" can be answered without typing blind. Esc refuses the prompt, which lets the command fail instead of hanging. The prompt takes over the keyboard while it is up, so esc cannot cancel the whole task by accident. The answer is never written to the transcript, never saved with the conversation and never sent to the model. In a headless run, where nobody is watching, a command that asks for a password still fails immediately rather than waiting.
- The installed CLI now renders with exactly the versions of React, ink and zustand it was developed and tested with. They used to be installed from the registry at install time within a version range, without a lockfile, so an installation could get newer releases (React 19.3.0 instead of 19.2.3) and render differently from a development build. They are now bundled into the CLI, together with the packages ink depends on (the layout engine, the text width and wrapping helpers, the React reconciler), and the few dependencies that are still installed are pinned to exact versions. The release workflow now also writes the same list of dependencies as the local build script, which it did not do before (it left out execa).
- New CLI command `/clear`: starts a new task and wipes the terminal, scrollback included, so the next conversation begins on a blank screen with the welcome banner. `/new` is unchanged and still leaves the previous conversation readable above. Both now also reset the transcript promotion watermark, which had been carried over from the previous task and promoted the next task's first messages into scrollback while they were still streaming.
- File edits in the CLI now show a real coloured diff instead of the raw SEARCH/REPLACE text. Removed lines sit on a red band, added lines on a green band, and the `<<<<<<< SEARCH`, `=======` and `:start_line:` scaffolding is gone from the preview, so all eight preview rows carry actual changes. Edits that report their diff in the `content` field (`write_to_file` and editor-backed edits, which send a unified diff and no `diff` field) used to render no preview at all and now render one too.
- The CLI's limit on how long a shell command may run is now configurable. It was fixed at 300 seconds, so a longer job (a build, a scraper) was always stopped with "Command execution timed out after 300 seconds" and the model was told not to run it again. Set `"commandExecutionTimeout": 1800` in `~/.roo/cli-settings.json` or pass `--command-execution-timeout 1800` for one run; `0` means no limit. The default stays 300. A value that is not a whole number of seconds (such as `"10m"`) stops the run at startup instead of silently removing the limit.
- The CLI now stops with `error: too many arguments` when it gets more arguments than it understands, instead of silently ignoring them. This also covers options written after the prompt: `tumble "fix the bug" -w ~/project` used to start in the current directory and ignore `-w`; write the options first, `tumble -w ~/project "fix the bug"`. Extra words after `tumble upgrade` or `tumble list modes` are reported the same way. The argument parser (commander) moves from version 12 to 15.
- The CLI footer now draws a ten-cell bar in front of the context percentage, so how much of the context window is left can be read at a glance instead of decoded from a number. The bar turns yellow from 80% and red from 95%, and only fills its last cell at a true 100%.
- The CLI settings file takes the context window of a model: `"models": { "GLM-5.3-NVFP4": { "contextWindow": 262144 } }`. An OpenAI-compatible server lists its models without their sizes, so the CLI assumed 128,000 tokens for every one of them and condensed the conversation at about 115,000, however large the model really was. The size applies wherever the model runs (top level, a mode entry or `--model`). The footer's context bar now measures against the same size the condensing uses; for these models it used to measure against 200,000, so it read 60% at the moment the conversation was condensed.
- The CLI's context gauge now sizes the model exactly like the extension does, so it fills at the same point where condensing starts. It used to assume 200,000 tokens for a model id the provider does not list (the extension uses the provider's default model, for example 1,000,000 for Z.ai), for DeepSeek aliases, for an Ollama or LM Studio model that is not loaded (the extension uses 128,000), and it ignored the 1M context option of Anthropic and Vertex Claude models.
- In the CLI, picking a file whose path contains spaces from the `@` file list now inserts a mention the agent can read (spaces escaped as `\ `, as the VS Code chat does). Before, the agent saw only the part of the path before the first space.
- The CLI no longer answers a follow-up question with an empty reply when the model offers a blank suggestion: the countdown and the print-mode default pick the first suggestion that has text, and blank suggestions are not listed. The `cost` in the CLI's JSON output is now the cost of the whole task instead of its last request. The CLI matches task history to the workspace the same way the extension does (paths are case-sensitive on macOS).
- In the CLI, picking a follow-up suggestion that names a mode (shown as "→ code mode") now switches to that mode before answering, as the VS Code chat does; the automatic pick after the countdown switches too when actions are allowed. Two suggestions with the same text but different modes are now told apart, and a malformed question from the model no longer shows as "[object Object]".
- The CLI now reads its global MCP servers from `~/.roo/mcp.json`, the same format as a project's `.roo/mcp.json`, one level up. Until now the global list lived in a hidden file inside the CLI's internal storage (`~/.vscode-mock/global-storage/settings/mcp_settings.json`), and an `--ephemeral` run lost it entirely, so only project servers were ever connected in practice. The file is created empty on the first run. To share one list with the VS Code extension, set `mcpSettingsPath` in `~/.roo/cli-settings.json` to the extension's `mcp_settings.json`. Servers written into the old hidden file are no longer read; move them to `~/.roo/mcp.json`.
- The CLI's terminal renderer (ink) moves from 6.6 to 7.1.1. Holding Backspace in the prompt now deletes one character per repeat; before, repeats that the terminal delivered together were dropped. The Escape key now takes effect about 20 ms after the press, because the renderer waits that long to tell a lone Escape from the start of a key sequence. Streaming, long answers, tool rows, ctrl+o and resizing render as before.
- The CLI installer (`apps/cli/install.sh`) now downloads the CLI from the Tumble Code releases (krzychdre/Tumble-Code) instead of the old upstream Roo Code repository, and the CLI README shows the installer command from this repository. `pnpm dev` in apps/cli no longer points the CLI at roocode.com.
- In the CLI's expanded view (ctrl+o) the block that is still running now streams live: the reasoning of a thinking block, the output of a Bash command and the response of an MCP call show their newest lines under a "… +N lines" marker as they arrive, instead of staying collapsed until the block finished. The whole block still prints in full once it completes, and the collapsed view is unchanged.
- Approving an MCP call in the CLI now shows what is being approved. The terminal interface used to show only the title "Use_mcp_server", and print mode with `--require-approval` printed "Server: unknown" because it read the wrong field names. Both now name the server and the tool (or the resource URI) and list the tool's arguments. In the terminal interface the arguments are capped at 12 lines, each kept to one row, so the Yes and No choices always stay on screen. The conversation also shows each MCP call as one row, `MCP(server › tool)` with the server's answer under it, instead of the raw request JSON followed by an unlabelled answer.
- New CLI command `/mcp`: a panel with every MCP server of the session, global and project, showing whether each one is connected, how many tools it offers, and why it failed when it did. From the panel a server can be restarted (`r`), enabled or disabled (`space`, saved to its config file), and both config files can be reloaded after an edit (`R`). A server that fails to start is no longer silent: the terminal interface shows a notice pointing at `/mcp`, and print mode writes the reason to stderr.
- The CLI shows every file of a read that names several files at once. It used to show the read with no file list, because the extension sends the list under a field name the CLI did not read.
- The CLI no longer exits right away when `--oneshot` is combined with opening a task that had already finished (for example `--session-id` of a completed task, or picking one from the history). Opening such a task is now treated as waiting for your next message, and `--oneshot` exits when that continued task completes.
- CLI: the slash-command and file picker now follows every arrow key even when keys arrive faster than the screen redraws (a held arrow or a fast typist). Before, pressing down, down, Enter quickly could accept the first item instead of the third.
- The CLI picks the chosen provider's own default model when no model is given (for example GLM-5.3 with `--provider zai`); it used to send the OpenRouter id `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6` to every provider. The footer's context bar also knows the size of the models built into the extension (Z.ai, Anthropic, Gemini and the other providers with a fixed model list) instead of assuming 200,000 tokens, so GLM-5.3 is measured against 1,000,000.
- After `/new`, `/clear` or switching to another task, the CLI no longer hides the first answer of the new task when it happens to be word for word the same as the last answer of the previous task (for example asking "Say hi" twice). The CLI used to keep a note of the last answer across the reset and dropped the new one as a repeat.
- Opening an earlier task in the CLI (`--session-id`, `--continue` or the history picker) no longer shows an approval dialog or a follow-up question from the task's history. Every question the task had already answered was replayed as if it were being asked again, so the CLI could show, for example, "Read src/old.ts, do you want to proceed?" for a file read that happened long ago.
- The CLI no longer prints raw JSON such as `{"tool":"readArtifact",...}` as the assistant's answer when the agent reads a saved artifact or searches the task history. These steps now show as tool rows, for example `Read Artifact(0 B - 1.0 KB of 4.0 KB)` and `Search Task History(retry budget)`, the same way the VS Code chat shows them.
- CLI selection lists (approval and choice dialogs) now land on the right item when arrow keys arrive faster than the screen redraws: pressing down, down, Enter in quick succession confirms the third option instead of the second.
- The CLI spinner now shows two clocks: `total`, the time since you handed the turn to the agent (what the single number used to count), and `step`, the time of the current request to the model including the tools it called. A model that has been thinking for three minutes in one step is now visible as such instead of hiding inside a growing total. Past a minute both read as `16m 16s` instead of `976s`, past an hour as `1h 05m`.
- The CLI spinner now makes a noise instead of describing one. Where the line used to read `Interpolating…` or `Percolating…`, it reads `Kerplunk…`, `Sproing…` or `Boop…`: forty single-word sounds that start at the rock tumbler the product is named after (Rumble, Clunk, Whirr, Kerchunk), go on through what is inside the barrel (Sploosh, Glug, Squelch, Scritch) and end up in comic-book physics and small robot beeps (Boing, Fwoosh, Thwack, Blip, Meep). Nothing that reads like bad news on a status line made the cut, so there is no Bang, Crash, Squeak or Zap. The consultancy vocabulary is gone with it: no more Combobulating, Actualizing or Reconciling, and no more kitchen metaphors.
- The CLI's `--stdin-prompt-stream` mode no longer waits forever when stdin closes while the task it started rests on a failed API request, the mistake limit or the auto-approval request limit (for example under `--require-approval`, where nobody is left to answer). It now ends after about two seconds with a JSON error event and exit code 1. A stream whose task failed (such as an API request that cannot be retried) also exits with code 1 now instead of 0, the same as a `--print` run.
- The CLI's todo list rows now show what changed since the previous list (new items and status changes). The rows always compared with an empty list, because the message handler kept the todos it saw when the CLI started.
- The CLI transcript now puts the conversation first. Bash and MCP rows no longer print a preview of their output: a collapsed row is the command (or the MCP server and tool) plus one line counting the output, `⎿ … +27 lines (ctrl+o)`, and ctrl+o still prints all of it. Tool results and the `∴ Thinking` rows use a darker grey, so the eye skips them; before, they were not dimmed at all in GNOME Terminal and other VTE-based terminals, which ignore the dim attribute on RGB colours. Your own messages sit on a slate-blue band with an orange `❯` and bold text, so every turn stands out. The interactive CLI starts on a clean screen; the shell history above stays in the scrollback.
- Security: command auto-approval now sees every command bash will run. The allow and deny lists were checked against a split made by regular expressions that ignored escapes and quoting context, so a denied command could be auto-approved next to an allowed one, for example `echo \' && rm -rf x \'`, `echo "$(rm -rf x)"`, a substitution in an unquoted heredoc body, `(rm -rf x)`, `then rm -rf x` or a quoted command name such as `'r'm`. A new scanner follows bash's quoting rules character by character, lists the commands nested in substitutions, groups and heredoc bodies, and matches the deny list also after quote removal. A command whose name is only known after expansion (`$CMD`, `$'\x72m'`, a glob) is no longer auto-approved, and syntax the scanner cannot split with certainty (for example a `case` statement) asks instead of approving.
- Codebase indexing with the OpenRouter or Amazon Bedrock embedder now reports a wrong vector dimension right when the settings are validated, with a clear message naming the model's real dimension, instead of failing later with an unexplained "Bad Request" from Qdrant for every indexed file. The other embedders already did this.
- When VS Code starts with an existing code index and the catch-up scan cannot index the changed files (for example because the embedding server is down), the index status now shows the error instead of "Indexed". The existing index is kept, the failed files are retried by the next scan, and a connection error triggers the usual automatic retry.
- Code index settings: when you leave the Qdrant URL field empty and it fills in the default `http://localhost:6333`, the Save button now becomes enabled so the default can actually be saved.
- Codebase search no longer loses a file from the index when the file is saved or rewritten without any real change (for example by a formatter, a tool writing the same text, or a git checkout). The file watcher used to delete the file's search entries first and only then notice that the content had not changed, so the file stayed missing from search results until its content actually changed. Old entries are now removed only when the file is really re-indexed, and they are kept when re-indexing fails.
- Code index settings: an empty Qdrant URL or embedder base URL now says the field is required instead of "invalid URL", and an empty model dimension for OpenAI-compatible embedders shows a translated message instead of a bare "Required".
- Codebase indexing now writes the same search entries whether a file was indexed by the initial scan or by the file watcher after an edit. The watcher used a different id for each code block, so when a long line was split into several pieces only the last piece survived, and a file re-indexed by the watcher could end up with duplicate entries next to the ones written by the scan.
- A command that asks for a password can no longer freeze the CLI. Cloning a private repository used to print `Username for 'https://github.com':` over the interface and then lock it up completely, with no keystroke, esc or ctrl+c getting through until the five-minute command timeout fired. Closing the command's standard input never prevented this, because git, ssh and sudo ask for credentials on `/dev/tty`, a direct handle to the terminal that ignores every redirection; the command and the CLI then read the same keyboard and split the user's typing between them. Commands now run in their own session, with no terminal to reach for, so the same clone fails in under a second with `could not read Username: terminal prompts disabled` and the interface stays usable. Aborting a command also signals the whole process group now, which catches grandchildren that the previous process-tree walk could miss, and any command still running when the CLI exits is stopped rather than left behind.
- A finished task that you leave with "Start New Task" (or by opening another task, or with /new or /clear in the CLI) is now recorded as a completed task in telemetry. Before, only tasks whose completion was explicitly accepted with a "yes" answer were counted, which the chat and the CLI never send, so completed chat tasks were missing from the "Task Completed" events sent to the cloud.
- Faster task-history lookups (cancelling, reopening and cost totals no longer parse the whole conversation file) and fewer secret-storage reads and OpenAI Codex token refreshes on every UI state update; also removes dead message handlers and the settings migration that was scheduled for removal in September 2025.
- Internal cleanup with no visible change: every setting's default value now lives in one table, and the extension builds both its own settings view and the state it sends to the chat panel from that table, so the two can no longer disagree.
- Internal cleanup with no visible change: the extension's module layers no longer depend on each other in circles, and the mode list code shared with the chat panel no longer pulls in extension-only code.
- The "copy system prompt" preview now shows exactly the prompt a task sends: once a task has loaded a deferred MCP tool, the preview no longer lists that tool as still deferred, and a missing MCP setting counts as enabled in both places. The prompt the model receives is unchanged.
- Internal cleanup with no visible change: handing work to a subtask and returning its result to the parent task (including cancelling and resuming a subtask) is now handled in one place, so the separate copies of that logic can no longer drift apart.
- Internal: the handler for messages from the chat panel is split from one 3,400-line switch into 16 domain modules behind a lookup table. Behavior is unchanged; a snapshot test pins what each of the 137 message types does.
- Internal: every per-tool policy (checkpoints, context clearing, spill, slim toolset, ledger, descriptions) and the tool dispatch now come from one tool descriptor table, so adding a tool touches far fewer files. No change to tool names or to what the model sees.
- Internal: each tool's argument parsing (including the tolerant handling of loosely typed arguments from weaker models) now lives in one place per tool, with no change to how tool calls are read.
- Internal: every tool now declares its auto-approval category next to its other policies, so a new tool cannot be left out of the auto-approval rules by accident. Auto-approval decisions are unchanged.
- Internal cleanup: the task's helper modules and the tool failure bookkeeping are now fully type-checked, with no change in behavior.
- Internal cleanup with no visible change: the task history (loading, saving, deleting and exporting tasks, keeping several open panels in sync, and the storage-error banner) is now handled by one dedicated component instead of being spread through the main extension provider.
- Internal cleanup: the code that keeps your provider profiles in step with your cloud organization moved into its own module. Nothing changes for users.
- Reopening a task while the CLI supplies per-mode provider settings no longer switches the active provider profile from the profile store first; the mode-to-profile binding is now resolved in one place.
- Internal cleanup: background tasks and memory writers now run through their own module, with no change in behavior (stopping a task still never starts or waits for a memory writer).
- Internal cleanup: the sidebar and the plan review panel now build their webview page and its content security policy from one shared module. Nothing changes for users.
- Internal cleanup: the task events that the extension forwards (started, completed, aborted and eleven more) are now listed in one table, so a listener can no longer be attached without being removed again. Nothing changes for users.
- The file edit tools (edit, search_replace, edit_file, apply_patch) now share one approval, diff view and save step. Background memory tasks that edit with edit, search_replace or apply_patch no longer open a diff editor tab, and edit accepts an absolute path inside the workspace the same way search_replace does.
- Internal cleanup with no change in behavior: built-in tools and MCP server tools now receive their approval, result and error callbacks from one shared factory instead of two hand-copied versions, so a future fix to how tool results, approval feedback or tool errors are reported reaches both kinds of tools at once.
- Token usage and cost are no longer multiplied when an OpenAI-compatible server (o1/o3 family models, Qwen Code, or a Mistral/Codestral endpoint) repeats the running usage totals in every streamed chunk: only the final totals are counted.
- DeepSeek model list refreshed to DeepSeek's September 2026 catalog: the new default is `deepseek-flash` (DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash, which now reads images) next to `deepseek-v4-pro`, with the published limits and peak prices (off-peak is half). Profiles on the legacy names `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` keep working, since DeepSeek serves them with V4.1 Flash; profiles still on the retired `deepseek-chat` or `deepseek-reasoner` now show that the model is no longer available. The "low" thinking effort is now sent to DeepSeek as low instead of being raised to high.
- DeepSeek cache hits are now read from the field DeepSeek documents, so they are priced at the cache read price, and DeepSeek no longer shows cache writes it does not have. OpenRouter chats now show the tokens written to the prompt cache; the cost shown is still the one OpenRouter reports.
- Auto-approval now honours commands denied in the VS Code settings (including a workspace's .vscode/settings.json), so a command the settings list as denied is no longer run just because a broader allowed prefix matches. Allowed commands still count only from your own settings, so a cloned repository cannot grant itself auto-execution.
- The code-index settings no longer pre-fill the embedding dimension with 1536. Saving the settings used to store that number even when you never entered it, so an Ollama or OpenAI-compatible model with another dimension ended in a Qdrant "Bad Request"; the field now stays empty (with its placeholder) until you fill it in. If an earlier save already stored 1536 for such a model, correct the dimension once.
- The Anthropic, Claude on Vertex and MiniMax providers now use the current Anthropic SDKs (`@anthropic-ai/sdk` 0.128, `@anthropic-ai/vertex-sdk` 0.19, with `google-auth-library` 10). Requests, prompt caching and streamed answers are unchanged; when the Google credentials for Claude on Vertex cannot be loaded, the error now still names the reason (for example a missing key file).
- Upgrade the diff library to version 9. Edits to files without a trailing newline keep their +/- counts and their diff preview, and file names with non-ASCII characters stay readable in new-file diffs.
- The Gemini and Vertex (Gemini) providers now use version 2 of Google's Gen AI SDK. Requests are unchanged; pressing Stop just before a Gemini request starts now cancels it instead of letting the whole answer stream in.
- LM Studio model listing and model loading now use version 2 of the LM Studio SDK. It needs a current LM Studio (2026 builds): with an older one the model list stays empty and an error explains what to check. When Tumble Code loads a model for you, LM Studio's own GPU settings now apply instead of an even split across all GPUs.
- Upgrade the Mistral SDK to 2.7.0. Requests and responses stay the same; content types the SDK does not know yet no longer break a Mistral answer.
- The Ollama provider now uses version 0.6 of the ollama client library. Requests are unchanged; a Polish letter, Chinese character or emoji that arrives split between two network packets is no longer shown as two replacement characters.
- Upgrade the OpenAI SDK to version 7. Profiles whose API key is saved as an empty string (for example a keyless local OpenAI-compatible server) keep working.
- Upgrade the PDF reader (pdf-parse 2, pdf.js 5). Reading a PDF gives the same text as before, except that two pieces of text on one row are now separated by a space; small PDFs under 4 KB no longer fail in the CLI, and the extension bundle shrinks by about 10 MB.
- Codebase indexing now uses the Qdrant client 1.19 and undici 7 (the HTTP library the Qdrant client and the debug proxy rely on). Indexing and codebase search talk to Qdrant exactly as before; the update keeps the extension on supported, patched versions.
- The chat panel's test matchers move from @testing-library/jest-dom 6 to 7. This is a development toolchain change only: the chat panel behaves exactly as before.
- The chat panel's test environment moves from jsdom 26 to jsdom 30. This is a development toolchain change only: the chat panel behaves exactly as before.
- The glob matcher picomatch, bundled into the extension through the .env loader, moves from 4.0.4 to 4.0.7 (bug fixes for Windows basename matching, repeated extglobs and globstars in parentheses).
- The chat panel's build moves from @vitejs/plugin-react 5 to 6, with the React Compiler now running through @rolldown/plugin-babel. This is a build toolchain change only: the built chat panel is byte-for-byte the same as before.
- The test runner moves from Vitest 3 to Vitest 5 (with the Vitest UI package). This is a development toolchain change only: the extension, the webview and the CLI behave exactly as before.
- The chat and settings panels now run on React 19 (the same React as the command line client); nothing should look or behave differently.
- Settings, custom modes and MCP configuration are now validated with zod 4 (the schema library), in the extension and in the CLI. What is accepted and rejected stays the same; only zod's own wording of some errors changes. A missing field now reads "Invalid input: expected string, received undefined" instead of "Required", a wrong type reads "Invalid input: expected boolean, received string" instead of "Expected boolean, received string", an unknown choice reads 'Invalid option: expected one of "global"|"project"' instead of "Invalid enum value. Expected 'global' | 'project', received 'team'", and a missing or wrong `mcpServers` in an MCP settings file reads "expected record" instead of "Required" or "Expected object". Our own messages (for example "Slug must contain only letters numbers and dashes" or "Duplicate mode slugs are not allowed") are unchanged. Custom tools keep their parameter descriptions even when a tool was built against an older copy of the types package.
- Microsoft's deprecated webview UI toolkit is no longer part of the extension; every control that used it has been replaced by an equivalent that looks and works the same. The chat panel's main script is about 170 kB (5%) smaller.
- The small badges in the chat (the cost of a context condensation, the source of a skill or slash command) no longer come from Microsoft's deprecated webview UI toolkit. They look the same.
- Buttons that came from Microsoft's deprecated webview UI toolkit now come from the extension itself: the copy buttons on chat messages and diff errors, the terminal profile Configure button, the add and remove buttons for custom headers of OpenAI-compatible providers, and the reset buttons in the codebase index settings. They look and behave the same. One small difference: the 3px strip around the copy button of a diff error no longer counts as part of the button, so a click there expands the error like the rest of the header.
- Selecting a mode no longer wipes its MCP server restriction list, and switching to a profile without a custom temperature no longer stores an empty temperature. Both came from the old checkboxes, which reacted to a setting loaded from elsewhere as if you had clicked them. Checkboxes now come from the extension itself instead of Microsoft's deprecated webview UI toolkit. They look and behave the same, with two small fixes: a checkbox always shows the saved state (it could briefly show a click the settings did not accept), and its box keeps its full size next to a long label that wraps.
- The dropdowns for the MiniMax, Moonshot and Z.ai endpoints, the codebase index embedding model and the image generation model no longer come from Microsoft's deprecated webview UI toolkit. They look and work the same with the mouse and the keyboard, and after a choice the dropdown always shows the value that was actually saved.
- Links in the chat, settings, modes, MCP and marketplace screens look and behave the same as before, but no longer come from Microsoft's deprecated webview UI toolkit; this is the first step towards dropping that toolkit. The one visible difference: when an inline link is followed by a space, its hover underline and keyboard focus frame no longer extend over that space.
- The Tools / Resources / Instructions / Logs tabs of an expanded MCP server no longer come from Microsoft's deprecated webview UI toolkit. They look the same and work the same with the mouse and the keyboard (arrow keys, Home and End move between tabs).
- The small spinning progress rings (while a file loads in the chat, while an API request or a context condensation runs, while cloud sign-in waits) no longer come from Microsoft's deprecated webview UI toolkit. They look, spin and announce "Loading" to screen readers the same way.
- The "Save location" choice (Global or Project) in the Create New Mode panel no longer comes from Microsoft's deprecated webview UI toolkit. It looks the same and works the same with the mouse and the keyboard (Tab reaches the selected option, arrow keys move the selection).
- The multi-line text fields in the Modes view (role definition, when to use, custom instructions, global custom instructions), in the Create New Mode panel and in the Prompts and Context settings no longer come from Microsoft's deprecated webview UI toolkit. They look the same. Fixed on the way: in the Modes view, text you were still typing into a prompt field could be replaced by the old text (and the old text saved) when the extension refreshed the view before you left the field.
- The single-line text fields (provider settings, codebase index, modes, history search, cloud sign-in, profile rename, cost and request limits) no longer come from Microsoft's deprecated webview UI toolkit. They look and behave the same, including selecting the whole text when a rename field opens. Fixed on the way: in the Modes view, a mode description (and the other fields that save when you leave them) could lose what you were typing and save the old text when the extension refreshed the view before you left the field.
- Updated the file watcher library that restarts MCP servers when their files change (chokidar 5) and the proxy library behind the debug proxy setting (global-agent 4). Watching and proxying behave as before.
- Updated four small runtime libraries (p-limit 7, delay 7, uuid 14, os-name 7). On Linux the system prompt now names the distribution (for example "Ubuntu 24.04 LTS") instead of "Linux" and the kernel version, and on Windows desktops the OS name no longer needs a PowerShell call. A very long "write delay" setting (above about 24 days) now really waits instead of firing at once. Code index point IDs are unchanged, so existing indexes stay valid.
- Updated the worker pool library used for background token counting (workerpool 10). Token counts are unchanged.
- A file you expand in the "files changed in this conversation" panel now stays expanded while the model keeps answering, instead of collapsing on the next streamed update.
- When the model provider rejects a request because the conversation no longer fits the context window, the retry now actually sends a smaller request. Previously, if clearing old tool output was enough to fit, that decision was thrown away and the retry resent the exact request that had just been rejected, so all three retries failed the same way.
- Rewinding or restoring a checkpoint past a condense that ran after a "context window exceeded" error now also undoes that condense, so the model sees the same restored conversation as the chat.
- Reopening a task from history now respects your organization's allowed providers and models: a task whose profile is no longer allowed is not resumed, and you see why (also after Stop, a failed request, or a finished subtask returning to its parent).
- Update the translation libraries (i18next 26 and react-i18next 17) used by the extension and its panel; every language shows the same texts as before.
- The built-in `/init` command no longer shows example rules about packages and folders of the Tumble Code repository itself (some of which no longer exist); its examples are now clearly marked placeholders, so models stop copying them into your project's AGENTS.md as if they were facts.
- Update KaTeX, which renders math formulas in chat messages, to 0.18: aligned equations sit a little tighter and braces over sums are spaced more evenly.
- Long tasks with large tool outputs stream smoothly again: the chat no longer re-reads every tool result in the history on each streamed token just to find the current todo list.
- LiteLLM: DeepSeek cache misses are no longer counted as cache writes. LiteLLM passes DeepSeek's miss count through, and it was shown as cache writes and priced at the model's cache write price (free for DeepSeek, so the uncached part of every prompt cost nothing). Misses are now ordinary input at the input price, and cache writes that LiteLLM reports under its standard `prompt_tokens_details.cache_write_tokens` name are counted.
- LM Studio and OpenAI-compatible servers that do not report usage now have their context size estimated including tool results (such as file contents from read_file) and tool call arguments, so auto-condense triggers on time instead of far too late.
- LM Studio no longer re-tokenizes the whole conversation on every request to estimate the prompt size: counts of unchanged messages are remembered, so only the newest messages are counted and long local-model tasks spend far less CPU on each turn. The reported token numbers are exactly the same as before.
- LM Studio no longer freezes the start of a task or the model list when the server does not answer (or runs a version the extension cannot read): listing gives up after 10 seconds, a model load gives up after 60 seconds without progress, and an error message explains what to check. The extension also closes its LM Studio connections after each use.
- Diagnostic messages the extension already produced now reach the Tumble Code output channel (View > Output > Tumble Code) instead of being discarded: provider errors such as Bedrock throttling and quota classifications, memory writer failures, and one-off settings migrations. Each line carries a timestamp, the level and the component, for example `2026-09-24T14:05:31.123Z [warn] [bedrock] ...`. Only info level and above is written.
- Update the icon library to lucide-react 1.x: about 30 icons in the chat and settings (for example the to-do list, file, message, trash and settings icons) use the refreshed lucide drawings; no icon disappears.
- Made the machine-specific settings `tumble-code.customStoragePath`, `tumble-code.autoImportSettingsPath`, `tumble-code.debugProxy.serverUrl`, `tumble-code.cloudApiUrl`, `tumble-code.cloudProviderUrl` and `tumble-code.clerkBaseUrl` machine-scoped, so values from User settings (or Settings Sync) on a laptop no longer leak into a Remote SSH window. Migration note: after this change, in a Remote SSH window the value of `tumble-code.cloudApiUrl` must be set in the "Remote [SSH: ...]" settings tab on the server; the User-settings value no longer applies there. This is intended behavior. The same applies to the other settings in the list.
- Added a "Working over Remote SSH" section to the README documenting where state lives (per-host on the server), how to install the extension "in SSH", which settings are machine-scoped, and a diagnostic checklist (disk space, quota, inotify limits, extension Output channel) for broken remote sessions.
- Prices such as "$5 and $10" or "5$ and 10$" in chat messages now show as plain text instead of being partly rendered as a math formula; inline math like $x^2$ or $2^n$ still renders.
- File links in chat messages, such as "file:///path/to/a.ts" or "README.md:6", open the file again instead of rendering as empty links.
- Z.ai, Moonshot and Qwen Code now cap the max output tokens they request at the current model's limit, so a max output setting left over from a previously selected model no longer makes the request ask for more than the model allows.
- MCP servers: a failed connect or restart no longer leaves the hub marked as "connecting", which made every following API request wait up to 10 seconds. Editing the MCP settings file no longer restarts servers whose configuration did not change, deleting one server no longer restarts the others, other servers keep their file watchers, and a server gets one watcher per path instead of two (one file change used to restart it twice).
- Closing VS Code (or the last Tumble Code window) while MCP servers are still starting no longer leaves a started MCP server process running in the background.
- Deleting an MCP server no longer makes the extension re-read the settings file and re-check every server a moment later: the delete now counts as the extension's own edit, like every other settings change it writes.
- An MCP server whose command cannot be started (for example a mistyped path) no longer disappears from the MCP server list. It used to vanish together with its error, leaving only a short notification, and it could not be restarted. It now stays listed as disconnected with the reason, such as "spawn /path/to/server ENOENT", and restarting it tries to start the process again.
- An edit of an MCP settings file is no longer ignored when Tumble Code has just saved the other MCP settings file. After Tumble Code wrote the global MCP settings (for example when you changed a server's timeout or allowed a tool), a change you made to the project `.roo/mcp.json` within the next 0.6 seconds was never loaded, and the same happened the other way round; each file now has its own short "this was our own save" window.
- Memory now learns from finished chats: when a task has completed and you click "Start New Task" (or open or start another task), the background memory extraction and consolidation run for it, as intended. Before, they never ran after a normally completed task in the VS Code chat, and leaving a task no longer waits for memory writers that are still running.
- The memory background writers are much smaller and faster. Saving memories after a task and the periodic memory clean-up each used to start a full agent with the whole agent system prompt, sending 40-60 thousand tokens per request over up to ten requests. Each now asks the model one short question (about 2-3 thousand tokens) and writes the memory files itself, so they also work with small local models. The clean-up never deletes a memory: one it merges away moves to the `.archive` folder inside the memory folder.
- When the agent already saved a memory itself during a task, the background memory extraction at the end of that task is now skipped as intended. The check that looked for those saves read a field chat messages never have, so it never found one and the extraction always ran, spending an extra model call and risking duplicate memories.
- The `@` file search in the chat no longer walks the whole workspace with ripgrep on every query. The file list is kept per workspace and refreshed when files are created, deleted or renamed, when an ignore file (`.gitignore`, `.ignore`, `.rgignore`) changes, or after 30 seconds. Results after the first query of a word come back noticeably faster, especially in large workspaces.
- Update Mermaid, which draws diagrams in chat messages, to version 12 while keeping the familiar look: diagrams keep the classic layout and node sizes instead of Mermaid 12's new default style, and the new UML use case diagrams are supported.
- The copy button in the code tab of the Mermaid diagram viewer now turns into a check mark after copying, like the one in the diagram tab.
- A Mermaid diagram opened in the zoom window again is centered, instead of keeping the offset from the last time it was dragged.
- The Mistral API key label in the provider settings now has the same style and spacing as the other providers.
- Model descriptions in the model picker now use the same markdown rules as chat messages, so plain web addresses in a description become clickable links.
- The "Create New Mode" dialog now opens with a ready-to-use name and slug ("New Custom Mode", or the next free "New Custom Mode 2" and so on) as intended. The dialog used to clear both fields right after filling them, so the user always started from an empty name.
- Choosing an API profile in the Modes tab of Settings no longer throws away unsaved changes from the other Settings tabs without warning. It now shows the same "unsaved changes" question as the profile picker in the Providers tab, and loads the profile only if you choose to discard the changes.
- Moonshot (Kimi) now runs on the same OpenAI-compatible client as Z.ai: the Stop button cancels the request on the server, the API request timeout setting applies, tool calls show a live preview while they stream, the request asks for the final usage report and reads cache reads and writes from the documented fields, and kimi-k2-thinking gets its reasoning back during tool loops. The Vercel AI SDK packages are no longer shipped.
- Moonshot: a rate limit (HTTP 429) or an error reported in the middle of a response now shows up as a failed request with its real reason and is retried like any other provider, instead of the turn silently ending or failing with "No output generated".
- The nightly build is now bundled with the same settings as the release: network proxy support (global-agent) works again instead of being broken by bundling, and Node's punycode deprecation warning no longer appears.
- With auto-approve on, a task no longer retries forever when the provider answers "invalid key" (401), "forbidden" (403) or "not found" (404, for example an unknown model): these errors now stop and show the failure, so you can fix the API key, profile or model and press Retry. Other errors (including 400, rate limits and server errors) are still retried automatically as before. Declining the retry now really stops the task instead of sending the request again. In the CLI, an unattended run (print or JSON output without --require-approval) now exits with code 1 and the provider's error instead of hanging, and the interactive terminal UI offers a Retry dialog for these errors even when actions are auto-approved.
- Ollama: when the selected model is not pulled, the error now says so and shows the `ollama pull` command instead of the raw server text.
- OpenAI and OpenAI Codex no longer send a failed request a second time: a rate limit (429), an authentication error (401), a server error or a stream that broke off mid-answer used to make the same request reach OpenAI twice.
- Optional tool parameters stay optional after a request to an OpenAI-compatible provider. Converting the tool list for OpenAI strict mode used to rewrite the shared tool definitions in place, so after the first such request parameters like the working directory of `execute_command` or the mode of a follow-up suggestion no longer accepted `null` for every later request in the session, including requests to other providers after a mode switch. What is sent to OpenAI-compatible providers is unchanged.
- OpenRouter: when a specific provider is pinned and OpenRouter cannot be reached, the provider's last known limits and prices are now loaded from the local cache instead of falling back to the generic model values.
- OpenRouter: an error reported in the middle of a response (for example a rate limit or an upstream provider failure) now keeps its HTTP status, so automatic retries and the background-model fallback recognise it.
- The account picker under the chat box now goes back to your previous account when switching organizations fails, and stays locked until the switch has actually finished.
- A storage error no longer replaces the chat with the welcome screen: the short state update that reports the error no longer looks like a missing API key.
- Internal cleanup with no visible change: the streaming state of a tool call (for example the path of a file being written) is now kept on the task that runs it instead of on the shared tool objects, so parallel subagents can never mix up each other's streaming previews.
- While a task streams, its chat messages are written to disk once it has been quiet for a second (at least every three seconds) instead of after every single message; each write carries the whole conversation, so long tasks wrote hundreds of megabytes. The file is still written at once when the task starts, stops to wait for you, is cancelled, or when VS Code or the CLI closes. The chat view and cloud sync still receive every message immediately.
- With the Debug setting on, the Tumble Code output channel now logs one `[perf]` line per API request with the host-side work it caused: settings reads, messages posted to the chat view and their size, and task-file writes and their size.
- Large tool calls (for example a long file write) no longer slow the editor down while they stream: their preview is refreshed up to ten times a second instead of once per received token, which re-read the whole call every time. Small tool calls are shown exactly as before.
- Long model reasoning no longer slows the editor down while it streams: the thinking block is refreshed up to ten times a second instead of once per received token, which sent the whole reasoning so far to the chat every time. The first words still appear at once, and the finished reasoning is shown and saved in full, exactly as before.
- The chat view no longer receives the whole conversation again for every new message. Each new message is now sent on its own, so long conversations stay responsive (on 1,054 real tasks the data sent to the chat view for new messages drops from about 73 GB to about 1.2 GB). The CLI keeps receiving exactly what it received before.
- Settings changes, mode switches and other actions no longer resend the whole task history to the chat view each time. The history (about 4.5 MB for 1,000 tasks) now goes along only when it changed since the view last received it, and a newly opened or reloaded view still gets it in full, so the chat panel reacts faster with a long history.
- Internal: the atomic JSON writer (`safeWriteJson`) now lives in the shared core package instead of the extension folder, and the CLI bundles its file-locking dependencies instead of installing them separately. JSON files are written exactly as before.
- Internal: lint now rejects relative imports that reach into another workspace package and `vscode` imports in code shared with the webview, and the webview build cache now notices changes to that shared code.
- Internal: the environment variables and global slots through which the CLI hosts the extension are now named and typed in one place (`@roo-code/types` `cli-runtime.ts`), and both sides read them through it. No behavior change.
- Internal: the browser-safe helpers that lived in the extension's shared folder (mention and command parsing, todo lookup, cost and token-limit helpers, experiment flags, language names, tool groups) now live in the core and types packages, so the webview and the CLI import the same code. Nothing changes for the user.
- Internal cleanup with no visible change: each provider's settings fields are now declared once, and the older flat settings schema, the saved-profile field list and the CLI's model field are all read from that one declaration. The older openai schema now also accepts the model id that the settings screen already saves with every openai profile.
- Polish and Russian now show correctly inflected counts (for example "Znaleziono 2 wyniki", "5 podzadań") instead of falling back to English for 2 or more items, and French, Portuguese, Hindi and Russian no longer show "1 result" for 0 or 21 search results.
- Organization allow lists now recognize Moonshot, MiniMax, OpenAI - ChatGPT Plus/Pro, Qwen Code and Z.ai profiles, and the settings screen checks the OpenAI and OpenAI Compatible model you actually selected against the allowed models.
- Browsing your earlier prompts with the Up arrow now keeps its place while the model is still answering, and the chat input no longer re-renders twice for every streamed token.
- Re-enable the ESLint rules that were turned off to unblock the 2026-09-24 refactor and fix their findings: `no-useless-escape`, `no-empty`, `prefer-const`, `@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment` and `no-case-declarations` (src), `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports` (src, with a test-file carve-out and documented inline disables for deliberate lazy CJS loads), `no-unassigned-vars` (shared base config), and the stale `react/jsx-key` / `no-case-declarations` per-file overrides in the webview.
- Upgrade React across the monorepo to 19.3.0: webview-ui moves from react/react-dom 19.2.3 (with @types 19.2.x) to react/react-dom/@types 19.3.0, and the CLI's react range moves from ^19.1.0 to ^19.3.0. React 19.3 is additive-only (stable ViewTransition and Fragment refs, the browser() DOM entry point, Trusted Types support, RSC Context rendering) with no breaking changes against 19.2, so no source changes were needed; type-checks, lint, and both vitest suites pass on the new version.
- Update react-markdown, which turns chat messages and model descriptions into formatted text, to version 10; messages render exactly as before.
- Security refresh of the libraries the extension ships: the MCP SDK moves from 1.26.0 to 1.30.1, and the XML parser used by the AWS SDK, the Word document reader behind `.docx` attachments (mammoth and @xmldom/xmldom), undici, ws, form-data, jws, js-yaml, tmp, underscore and socket.io-parser move to their patched releases. Behaviour change from the MCP SDK: a single message from a local (stdio) MCP server larger than 10 MB is now rejected with a clear error instead of being buffered without limit.
- Security refresh of the libraries the chat panel ships: mermaid 11.17.2 (with DOMPurify 3.4.16) for diagrams, the Markdown renderer's mdast-util-to-hast 13.2.1, shell-quote 1.10.0 for command parsing, and axios 1.20.0 move to their patched releases. Mermaid 11.17 also recognises a few new diagram types. The build tools (Tailwind CSS 4.3.3, Vite 8.3.1) are refreshed too, which removes the vulnerable `tar` from the build.
- Storage failures are no longer silent. When the task history store or a provider profile save fails (for example a full disk, an exceeded quota or a read-only file system, which is easy to hit in Remote SSH windows where the storage lives on the server), the extension now shows a persistent red banner with the underlying cause above the chat and in the settings view, with a "Show logs" shortcut that opens the extension's Output channel. The banner disappears once storage works again. Error toasts for saving, renaming and loading provider profiles and for opening a task now also include the actual failure reason instead of a generic message.
- Connecting to an MCP server over SSE no longer replaces the process-wide `EventSource` in the extension host. The MCP SDK creates its own EventSource, so the replacement never affected MCP connections; it only changed a global that other code could see. The unused `reconnecting-eventsource` library is no longer shipped in the extension bundle, and 25 other dependency declarations that nothing used were removed from the workspace.
- The extension no longer opens an external IPC socket when the `ROO_CODE_IPC_SOCKET_PATH` environment variable is set. That socket existed only for the inherited evaluation harness, which has been removed together with its web dashboard; the extension API that other VS Code extensions call is unchanged, and the extension bundle no longer ships the `node-ipc` library.
- The model is told about your `.rooignore` file again: since May 2026 the system prompt sent to the model left out the `.rooignore` section, although "Copy system prompt" still showed it. Both now contain the same text.
- Stopped a lost inter-process write lock (reported by proper-lockfile as "compromised", which can happen on slow or remote filesystems) from crashing the extension host with an uncaught exception. The affected write operation now fails with a visible error instead, even when the write itself completed, because a compromised lock means another process may have written concurrently.
- The `search_replace` tool (used by xAI Grok models) now writes `$` sequences such as `$$`, `$&`, `` $` `` and `$'` exactly as the model sent them instead of expanding them, and it pauses for plan review after editing a plan file like the other write tools.
- If you never changed the terminal shell integration timeout, it is now 30 seconds instead of 5, and the settings screen shows the same value the extension uses. The fallback values the Settings Save button uses for notification sounds and checkpoints now match the extension defaults (sounds off, checkpoints on).
- Fix unsaved changes in Settings being thrown away after a settings import: once settings had been imported, any later update from the extension (for example a task message) reset the form. Now only a new import resets it.
- Saving the settings no longer turns MCP back on (or off) after you changed "Enable MCP" in the MCP tab of the same settings session.
- Saving the settings no longer turns on "Show .rooignore'd files" when the setting had no value: the Save button now uses the same default (off) as the extension.
- Update Shiki, which colors code blocks and diffs in the chat, to version 4: code looks the same, and 41 more languages (for example Odin, Justfile, KDL, Org and PowerShell under "pwsh") are now highlighted instead of shown as plain text.
- The skill mode picker (in the create-skill dialog and in the per-skill modes dialog) now runs on one shared piece of logic, so both behave the same way; no visible change.
- Pressing Stop now cancels the request on the server for Z.ai (GLM), DeepSeek, OpenAI and OpenAI Codex, so the model stops generating (and billing tokens) instead of finishing the answer in the background.
- OpenAI, OpenAI Codex and the OpenAI-compatible providers now prepare tool schemas with one shared converter; the schemas sent to models are unchanged, and a malformed custom tool property no longer makes an OpenAI or Codex request fail.
- Upgrade styled-components from 6.1.13 to 6.4.4 in webview-ui for proper React 19 compatibility (6.1 predates React 19: forwardRef deprecation warnings, ref-as-prop support). No `@types/styled-components` existed (6.x ships its own types). Also removes the now-obsolete `as CSSObject` cast in `StyledPre` since 6.4 ships csstype 3.2.3, matching React 19's `CSSProperties`.
- A workspace folder added to an open multi-root workspace now starts code indexing on its own, the same way the folders that were open when the extension started do (if indexing is enabled and configured). Before, such a folder stayed unindexed and codebase_search was not offered for tasks in it until the index settings were saved or indexing was started by hand. A folder removed again right away no longer leaves a file watcher running.
- Codebase indexing no longer leaves file watchers behind: after Stop and Start the index status keeps updating for file changes, an error recovery no longer leaves a second watcher indexing, and removing a workspace folder stops its indexer.
- A slash command in `~/.roo/commands` now overrides a built-in command of the same name in the slash menu too, not only when it runs. With subfolder rules on, the workspace is scanned for nested `.roo` folders once instead of three times per request, the slash menu no longer re-reads every command file on each keystroke, and nested `.roo` folders are no longer dropped silently in workspaces with more than 500 files inside `.roo` folders.
- Searching files with an invalid regular expression now tells the model what is wrong with the pattern instead of reporting "No results found", and every ripgrep search (file search, @-mention search, file listing) now shares one runner with a time limit, so a stuck search can no longer hang the task.
- Terminal commands now behave the same in the VS Code terminal and in the CLI: live output arrives at one steady rate (and a line printed just before a pause is no longer held back), output printed right before "Proceed while running" is kept, and a command that was stopped is reported as killed instead of as a successful exit.
- Listing code definitions and indexing code no longer reload the language grammar for every file and no longer leak parser memory: each grammar is loaded once and reused, parse trees are freed after use, and everything is released when the extension shuts down.
- Internal cleanup: the extension-only cloud URL and VS Code language model selector helpers moved out of the code shared with the webview, and the webview build now fails if it ever reaches extension-only code again. No behavior change.
- Internal cleanup of the diff view used for file edits, with no visible change: the tool result text a model receives after a file write stays byte for byte the same, and the diff view is now told whether it creates or modifies a file when it opens instead of relying on a value every edit tool had to set beforehand.
- Codebase indexing no longer loses track of stale search results when Qdrant refuses to delete them. A failed delete used to be logged and ignored, so the index kept the old code chunks of deleted or changed files forever while the extension believed they were gone; now the failure reaches the file watcher and the scanner, which keep the file marked for another attempt.
- Codebase indexing: every embedding provider now behaves the same way. An oversized code chunk is shortened instead of silently dropped (dropping it paired the following chunks with the wrong vectors), Ollama requests are split into batches and retried on rate limits like the others, a rate limit at one provider no longer slows down a different endpoint, and a failed request is reported once instead of up to four times.
- Codebase indexing with nomic-embed-code (Ollama or OpenAI-compatible) now embeds your code without the search-query instruction "Represent this query for searching relevant code: ", which the model expects only on search queries. An existing nomic-embed-code index is rebuilt once, automatically, the next time indexing starts, so old and new vectors are never mixed. Other embedding models are not affected and keep their index.
- A failed task history store initialization no longer stays broken until the window is reloaded. Previously one transient I/O error at startup (for example a briefly full disk on a Remote SSH server) made every task operation and the whole state refresh fail forever; the extension now retries the store initialization on the next use (with a short cooldown to avoid hammering a permanently broken file system), and while the store is down the UI keeps working with an empty task history instead of throwing, with the failure reason still shown in the storage error banner. Once storage works again the task history recovers without a window reload.
- Commands that keep running in the background now report their remaining output and their end to the model when they finish in the CLI, and in the extension when terminal shell integration is disabled, and stopping a backgrounded command in a VS Code terminal (user timeout, cancelling the task) now actually interrupts it.
- A task that ends with a plain text answer (no tool call) now shows that answer once, as the "Task Completed" result, instead of the same text twice (once as a message, once as the result). The shortcut that turns such a text-only turn into the completion also no longer steps aside when the only open reminder is "In Progress": with weak models that item is routinely the delivery itself, and the "you did not use a tool" retry only made the model regenerate the same answer through attempt_completion (an extra request, about ten seconds, and the output paid for twice). Reminders still "Pending" keep the retry, so a model narrating mid-task does not complete the task by accident.
- Approving a todo list update no longer applies another task's list: when a parallel subagent updated its own todo list while you were approving the main task's list, the main task used to take over the subagent's list and report it as your edit.
- Token counting keeps using its background worker after a short burst of requests fills its queue, instead of moving every later count onto the editor's main thread for the rest of the session.
- When a tool fails, the model now receives only the error message (and the message of its cause, if any) instead of the full serialized error with its stack trace. The stack wasted context on every failure, exposed local file paths, and tended to distract weaker models from the actual problem. The stack is still written to the log, and the error shown in the chat is unchanged.
- File edits streamed by parallel subagents no longer disturb the main task's edits: the live preview of a file being written shows up again while subagents are also writing, a write to an existing file is no longer labelled as a new file after another task finished its own write, and a failed edit no longer leaves its row spinning when another task edited a file at the same time.
- Fix code definitions and code indexing for `.erb`, `.ejs` and `.htm` files, which were never parsed, and stop `.elm` and `.vb` files from failing when their definitions are requested (Elm files are now indexed in plain chunks).
- When you edit the todo list while approving an update, the chat now shows the list as you left it, and that row no longer re-renders in an endless loop.
- A Google Vertex profile with a Claude model no longer causes an unhandled error when its Google credentials cannot be loaded (missing key file, no application default credentials). The Vertex client looks the credentials up as soon as it is created, so the failure used to surface as an unhandled promise rejection even when the profile was only read for model info (for example while exporting settings), which made the CLI exit. The error is now reported only on the first request, as a normal Vertex error.
- Google Vertex profiles keep the credentials JSON you paste into settings: it is now saved in VS Code secret storage with the profile instead of being dropped on save, and a copy left in plain global state by earlier versions is moved into secret storage.
- The chat view stays responsive while an answer streams in a long task: it no longer re-parses every tool message in the history on each streamed token (about 90 ms per token in a 400-message task with 9 MB of tool output, now well under 1 ms), and the file changes panel no longer does either.
- The chat panel opens faster: it now loads only English plus your interface language instead of all 18 translations, which cuts the main webview script by about a third.
- The chat panel opens faster: the math renderer (KaTeX) and the Mermaid diagram engine now load the first time a message contains a formula or a diagram, instead of with every panel.
- The chat panel no longer loads the plan review screen's code at startup; it is fetched only when a plan review panel opens.
- Chat rows no longer search the whole task history each time they draw: the end time of a block, the previous todo list and the subtask link now come from one pass over the history in the chat view, which keeps long tasks responsive while an answer streams in.
- Internal cleanup of the codebase indexing settings popover: each embedding provider's form now comes from one registry with shared field components, and the settings view and the popover share one "unsaved changes" dialog, with no change in behavior.
- Internal: the extension panel now receives messages from the extension through one shared listener instead of one listener per component. Nothing changes for the user.
- Internal: the settings, marketplace, worktree, code index, plan review and chat input components now receive extension messages through the shared message listener. Nothing changes for the user.
- When several parts of the panel show the same provider's model list (for example the chat input and the settings), the extension is now asked for the list once instead of once per part, and a refresh in one place updates the list everywhere.
- Internal: the chat view is split into smaller hooks (sounds, approval buttons, message composer, extension messages, checkpoint navigation, mode shortcuts) and is now optimized by the React Compiler. Nothing changes for the user.
- Internal: the chat view now receives extension messages through the shared message listener, the last component that still had its own. Nothing changes for the user.
- The "Condensing context" row in the chat no longer restarts on every streamed token. It was rebuilt from scratch each time the chat list updated, so its spinner kept restarting while the context was being condensed.
- Internal cleanup of the webview state store: unused setters, the unused editor theme conversion and duplicated settings state were removed, with no change in behavior.
- Buttons and messages that showed a raw translation key (the auto-approve select all/none buttons, the dismiss button on notices, the LiteLLM refresh error and the OpenAI Codex sign-in/out buttons) now show translated text in every language.
- The Worktrees view now shows its "not supported in multi-root workspaces" message and the "Git root" label instead of the raw translation keys, and 240 interface strings that no screen used any more were removed from all 18 languages.
- The memory directory validator now rejects a bare filesystem root on Windows too. "/" is an absolute path there (the current drive's root) and used to slip past the check that only looked for a drive letter, so a misconfigured auto memory directory could point memory writes at the root of the drive. Five unit test files that compared product paths against POSIX string literals were also fixed so the Windows CI job passes.
- The Windows CI unit test job no longer times out. Its vitest pool ran all test files in one process without per-file isolation (singleFork), so leaked globals, stray timers and unbounded heap growth accumulated until whole test files froze at the 20 second limit. Test files now still run one at a time on Windows CI but each in a fresh process. The memory background writers also bail out early when auto memory is disabled, which removes the "autoDream trigger failed" noise from the Task test logs.
- The system prompt's operating system line is resolved once per session instead of on every request. On Windows the lookup shells out synchronously to `wmic` (or to PowerShell where wmic no longer exists) to tell desktop and Server editions apart, which froze the extension host for seconds before each API call. The Task unit tests that were meant to stub the system prompt now stub the method the API loop actually calls, so they no longer build the real prompt (and no longer hit that shell-out on Windows CI).
- A file written by write_to_file now always lands at the path the model asked for. When the model sent the file content before the path and the path contained an escaped character, the diff view could open for a cut-off prefix of the path (for example `a/b` instead of `a/b.ts`); the file was then created under that shorter name while the approval card showed the full one. The early diff view is now closed and undone as soon as the real path is known.
- Fix xAI (and Anthropic and Bedrock) requests failing with "message.content is not iterable" after a task switched from an OpenAI or Codex mode: the OpenAI encrypted reasoning of earlier turns is now left out for providers that cannot read it, and sent again when the task switches back to OpenAI.
- Z.ai GLM models can now give longer answers. GLM-4.5, GLM-4.6, GLM-4.7, GLM-5 and the GLM-4.6V vision models were limited to 16,384 output tokens although Z.ai allows 96K (GLM-4.5 family), 128K (GLM-4.6 and newer) or 32K (GLM-4.6V). By default they now use up to 20% of their context window (about 40,000 tokens on the 200K models, 26,215 on the 128K ones), and the Max Output Tokens slider in the provider settings lets you raise it up to the documented limit. GLM-4.5V now uses its documented 64K context window instead of 128K.
- Added the GLM-5.3, GLM-5-Turbo and GLM-5V-Turbo models to the Z.ai provider on both the international and the China API lines, and made GLM-5.3 the new default model
- Kept reasoning enabled for GLM-5.3, which rejects requests that ask it to turn thinking off, on both the Z.ai provider and the generic OpenAI-compatible path
- Corrected stale Z.ai pricing: GLM-5 on the international line, plus GLM-5, GLM-5.1 and GLM-5.2 on the China line
- Fixes ported from the Zoo-Code fork:
- **Terminal keeps your locale.** Commands no longer run with `en_US.UTF-8` forced over a UTF-8 system locale such as `pl_PL.UTF-8`, which printed `setlocale` warnings and changed program output.
- **File search on newer VS Code.** ripgrep is found again in the package layout used by VS Code 1.130 and later; before, file search and listing failed, and a missing ripgrep broke the whole environment summary sent to the model.
- **Tasks use their own mode.** A background task, subagent or delegated subtask now gets the tools, rules, skills and MCP servers of its own mode instead of the mode of the task you are looking at. Deleting a custom mode also moves the running task out of it.
- **Codebase search** searches the index of the task's workspace folder, not the folder of the active editor.
- **Follow-up suggestions.** Blank or missing suggestion answers from the model no longer break the chat or get auto-approved as an empty reply.
- **Reasoning display.** When a model sends reasoning and answer text in one chunk, the reasoning is shown first instead of splitting the answer into extra rows (OpenAI-compatible servers, Z.ai, DeepSeek, LiteLLM, Qwen Code).
- **Reasoning effort settings.** The selector no longer shows a blank value after switching to a model that does not offer the saved effort, and it shows the model's default effort when none is saved.
- **Providers.** A custom Anthropic model id is used as entered instead of being replaced by the default model; OpenAI Codex one-shot requests (prompt enhancement, condensing) no longer fail with HTTP 400; Claude on Vertex no longer crashes on an empty completion; token usage is reported again for hosts whose name merely contains "x.ai".
- **Reliability.** Interrupted tool calls are saved as errors in the task history; creating `mcp_settings.json` from the CLI and the extension at the same time no longer overwrites it with an empty file; a child task view no longer jumps back to Home during rapid state updates; a non-text VS Code terminal profile setting no longer throws.
- **Architect mode** now tells the model to save plans in `./plans` relative to the workspace, instead of `/plans`, which models took as an absolute path.
- Zooming a Mermaid diagram or an image with the mouse wheel no longer scrolls the chat behind the zoom window.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- **Tumble Code is a new tool.** This is the first release of Tumble Code, the community fork of Roo Code, rebranded and repositioned around local inference engines (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, and other locally-hosted LLMs) so you can run AI coding assistance entirely on your own hardware without paying per token. The original Roo Code team moved on to their new product; Tumble Code picks up maintenance from here. User-visible identity (extension display name, marketplace publisher, URLs, output channel) now reads "Tumble Code", while internal command and view IDs (`roo-cline.*`) are preserved so your existing keybindings keep working. Configuration property keys moved from `roo-cline.*` to `tumble-code.*`; the first launch after installing Tumble Code offers to migrate your settings from the legacy Roo Code extension.

### Minor Changes

- **Vision mode.** A new built-in mode that gives text-only models the ability to look at images. Any other mode can hand an image to Vision mid-task and get back a text description it can keep working with, so your daily text-only model gains eyes without you switching model entirely.
- **Reviewer mode upgraded to a full code-review mechanism.** The reviewer no longer just checks the diff. It reviews your change against the task's intent, flags re-implemented logic and silent contradictions, proposes better solutions instead of only complaints, reads the surroundings of changed code, consults architectural decisions recorded in the memory system, and ends with a clear verdict (APPROVE, APPROVE WITH COMMENTS, or REQUEST CHANGES).
- **Self-hosted cloud backend.** Replaces the old Roo-owned cloud with a backend you run yourself (a Dockerized Python API with Authentik authentication). You can share tasks and control the extension remotely from your own infrastructure, with no dependency on a vendor-operated cloud.
- **Cloud web dashboard.** A web interface for your self-hosted backend: browse the task list, read per-task summaries with cost and token breakdowns, watch usage metrics (tokens, cost, duration, broken down by model and mode), and hover a prompt to preview its content.
- **Agent interchange with Claude Code.** Tumble Code and Claude Code running on the same machine can now hand tasks to each other and read each other's task analyses, plans, and session history. Work started in one agent can be continued in the other without re-explaining from scratch, and a shared memory directory keeps long-lived facts in one place.
- **Background model for compaction and memory.** Configure a dedicated, cheaper model for context compaction and memory writes, with automatic fallback to the main task model if the background model is offline or errors mid-call.
- **Turn economics overhaul.** Substantial work to cut token waste on weaker and self-hosted models: fixes a compaction oscillation that re-billed the full context every other turn, reduces one-tool-per-turn behaviour, and stops re-reading the same files repeatedly. Long runs on local models are now faster and cheaper.
- **Auto-approve: semi and fully autonomous modes.** The auto-approve control now supports semi-autonomous and fully autonomous operation, and the trigger box reflects the active mode through its icon, orange border, and label.
- **Per-mode MCP allowlist.** Control which MCP tools each mode is allowed to use, configured per mode.
- **Ask mode eager web search.** Ask mode proactively runs web searches to ground its answers.
- **Architect plan approval gate.** Architect mode now produces a plan you approve before any work proceeds.
- **Parallel subagents with worktrees.** Subagents can run in parallel in separate git worktrees and are persisted and rehydrated across sessions.
- **Context usage bar.** Context usage is shown as a bar instead of a circle, clearer at a glance.
- **Terminal shell override.** Choose which VS Code integrated-terminal shell profile Tumble Code uses to run commands.
- **Microcompaction (non-destructive).** A lighter context-compaction layer that trims context without destroying information, so long tasks stay coherent longer.
- **Custom notification sounds.** Replaced the old text-to-speech feature with custom notification sounds, localized across all supported languages.
- **GitHub-style alerts in markdown.** The chat now renders GitHub-style alert callouts (NOTE, TIP, WARNING, and others).
- **Multiline quoted command parsing.** Shell commands split across multiple quoted lines are now parsed correctly.
- **Ripgrep diagnostic command.** A built-in diagnostic command to inspect ripgrep behaviour when search acts up.
- **Assign one model to several modes at once.** A single API profile can now be assigned to multiple modes in one action.
- **New and updated models.** Added Claude Opus 4.7 and 4.8 (across Anthropic, Bedrock, and Vertex), Fable 5, GLM-5.1 and GLM-5.2, DeepSeek V4, Gemini 3.5 Flash, GPT-5.5 and GPT-5.6, and Fireworks glm-5.1, kimi-k2.6, and deepseek-v4-pro. GLM-4.7 became the default for the Z.AI lines. LiteLLM reasoning streaming is now supported. GLM models engage retained thinking when reasoning effort is set to medium or higher, and their max output tokens are configurable. Deprecated OpenAI models were removed from the catalog.

### Patch Changes

- **Diff view stability.** A series of fixes for the diff view: it no longer crashes when a reset races with a streaming update, silent save failures and stranded saves are resolved, and stale dirty tabs left open after a save are closed.
- **Terminal cancellation.** Running terminal processes are now terminated when a task is cancelled, with a retry for processes that need multiple Ctrl+C signals to stop.
- **Checkpoint cursor.** The checkpoint cursor no longer resets on every streamed message tick.
- **Settings import.** Settings and the marketplace stay reachable after importing a settings file that contains some invalid keys; the valid keys are still applied.
- **Vertex AI.** Added European and US multi-region endpoints, and a warning when a file path is pasted into the Google Cloud Credentials field.
- **Gemini.** Custom model IDs are now honored instead of falling back to defaults, and MCP tool schemas are sanitized before being sent.
- **Grok diffs.** Truncated Grok diffs with missing markers are repaired automatically.
- **Ripgrep.** The ripgrep binary is located correctly in the new universal package layout.
- **Markdown.** Text wrapped in a single tilde is no longer struck through.
- **Temperature.** The temperature parameter is omitted for models that do not support it.
- **PowerShell.** PowerShell is correctly reported on Windows when no shell profile is configured.
- **LM Studio.** Models load on first open even before the base URL has been saved.
- **Code indexing.** Indexing retries on connection failures and reports a clear error when the vector dimensions do not match the configured model.
- **Large transcripts.** The chat no longer crashes on out-of-memory with very large transcripts.
- **Shared tasks.** Sharing a task always backfills the full task content, and time a task spent closed is no longer counted as time it ran.
- **Approval button.** The approval button no longer flashes during auto-execution.
- **Celebration sound.** The celebration sound no longer replays when you reopen a completed task from history.
- **Welcome screen.** Tall welcome-screen content now scrolls instead of being clipped.
- **Shift+Enter.** Shift+Enter keeps inserting newlines in newline mode.
- **Translations.** Missing translations were filled in across 17 locales.

> The entries below are preserved from the preceding Roo Code lineage for historical reference. Tumble Code is a community fork of [Roo Code](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code) and picks up maintenance where the original team left off.

## 3.53.1

### Patch Changes

- Suppress celebration sound when reopening a completed task from history
- Previously, opening a completed task from the history list replayed the
- "task completed" celebration sound because the rehydrated `clineMessages`
- already end in the original `completion_result` ask, which the ChatView
- sound effect treated as a fresh completion. The sound now only plays when
- the `completion_result` is genuinely new — i.e. the active task did not
- just switch and the last-message timestamp advanced within the same task.
